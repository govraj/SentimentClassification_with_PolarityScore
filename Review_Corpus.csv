Restaurant,description
Fable,recommendation make reservation pork rib special night crispy halibut salad fat tug oyster chickpea fritter smoker frazier duck breast they switch up menu because they are farm table restaurant which make nice since you can get variety alcohol also farm table you will not find tour typical brand hard liquor
Fable,could not ask more slow night restaurant they about close but accommodated u we very hungry but not wanted eat heavy we ordered chickpea fritter n beet salad n omg my best chickpea fritter ever heavenly fresh n soft eat beet salad even better guess fresh ingredient flavoured well in fact there many food item tempted eat but not watch my big growing stomach forgot name my cocktail but delicious n refreshing there are good desert well like cheesecake toffee caramel truffle loved ambience n decor inside peck clean n covid precaution taken staff very gracious n smiling would love go back try duck dish
Fable,whoa it s been and wait worth now vegan it s been hard find really good place fancy pant dining am in love with place food everything perfect and it s got everything from vegan vegetarian and blood eater alike dish start chickpea fritter chickpea and plant based eater it s happy marriage they come single and could eaten meal and roasted beet yummy they had pasta special vegan which pesto and pea shoot plate fantastic love my green give plate full green i m super happy my pescatarian love ordered salmon dish which also sounded amazing except weird combination chorizo in thought should add should not plate could missed not paying attention not surprise non meat eater would appreciate eaten in little bit everyone price are little bit high but would definitely back date
Fable,came brunch date saturday around noon and got seated right away but we definitely got last open seat in restaurant you re coming prepared start getting crowded around then liked how they sweet and savory option their menu they offer variety different egg benedict we opted their traditional egg benny and their french toast good however portion size little small what you re paying egg benny perfectly done yolk runny and flavor good really liked these rostis thats side it like flattened tater tot crispy goodness their french toast one thicc slab bread topped with mascarpone cream farm fresh berry and candied walnut dish little too sweet my liking really impressed with bread toast very caramelized outside but inside very soft felt like we eating dessert haha their staff kind and patient and helpful ambiance in restaurant definitely comfortable yet little fancy and could romantic meal too
Fable,there are many brunch spot stretch th ave and fable one better option they recently expanded their menu include frittata and toast avocado blt etc sampled veggie frittata with creamy goat cheese asparagus and healthy pile green top served with delicious potato r sti side toast and housemade raspberry jam component came together beautifully and r sti are more like sophisticated flattened tater tot in best possible way darling show in my book along with fresh raspberry jam service warm and efficient frittata are listed taking minute menu but everything seemed served up with speed restaurant can seem bit dark especially you re seated near back but in experience worth repeating in my book total bill with tax and tip came out about which again vancouver s magic number brunch lunch sans drink
Fable,such treat coming spend evening in kit with life long friend we planned dinner before firework and we re thrilled when we able get spot fable last minute restaurant from exterior not look like anything special but walking just few step inside confirmed reservation good choice we walked past bar in front open kitchen and cannot lie little envious their seat love cooking and sitting there would been dream watching them put out those plate pure pleasure haha we keep walking though our table back intimate and simple modern farmhouse restaurant our waiter funny engaging and efficient had great knowledge ingredient used in menu developed from farm table concept love type cooking super enjoyable hearing great attention providing food equally delicious fresh and local drink menu something everyone our husband not drink alcohol having really creative non alcoholic beverage really well received haha knowledge our server had wine menu u girl enjoy glass wine with our meal food very satisfying freshness creativity presentation flavour profile bang thank you fable lending u seat such enjoyable night great food laughter and conversation we will highly recommended and hope back soon
Fable,really excited about coming because i ve heard much however service really slow and food mediocre got egg benedict and nothing rave about however hash brown really good
Fable,fable been my list long time and i m disappointed taken long try out love they support local farm and get fresh ingredient daily they even rooftop garden grow their ingredient we came my birthday dinner and greeted quickly by hostess they open kitchen right front with bar seating well regular table in back we told by server their dish are meant family style which most ideal trying bit everything oyster fish chip each order only piece medium sized beer battered fried oyster tartar topped with mini french fry perfect spoonful deliciousness batter light and tartar refreshing balance rooftop serrano pepper appy quite large u there about small roasted pepper in white foam topped with chicharron spiciness pepper are always surprise but not worry these range little sweet mildly spicy smoked duck breast perfectly cooked tender duck breast with roasted parsnip duck confit croquette and cabbage croquette tasted more like carrot potato croquette however bc halibut with short rib pea risotto miso and halibut dashi dish my least favourite because halibut overcooked halibut pan fried leaving outside crispy but inside dry there only few small piece short rib but they quite tender pea risotto with dashi tasty even with many pea in overall wonderful birthday dinner
Fable,cool diner feel nice setup and good food very reasonably priced
Fable,cute little place brunch my boyfriend and came sunday and there wait around noon we ordered benny our server little frazzled but super friendly good service and good food super busy weekend i d recommend going little earlier you can
Fable,we stopped lunch our way out town after husband read great review we just popped in hoping there would place u and they great job accommodating u restaurant fun vibe with awesome and unique chandelier in center and interesting art wall whole restaurant pretty small including dining area tiny little open kitchen and couple small bathroom in back they good job with space though and lot nice seating our server really nice and attentive they gluten free option their menu and able point in right direction husband can never turn grilled cheese little boy inside him win every time smile side table disappeared think pretty spot had burger lettuce wrapped and good we had nice service and quick and pleasant lunch before heading back seattle area
Fable,had dinner night visiting kitsilano from seattle occasionally i ve found yelp review overinflated when visiting city looking you portland however fable fully deserves excellent reputation it s garnered food favorite entree tie gnocchi with double add pork belly and duck breast seriously order closely followed by steak steak s crispy potato understated however two cheese aligot aka cheesy whipped potato which also come with entree my overall favorite side balanced out favorite appetizer duck meatball and tomato soup beet solid appetizer cute and flavorful there nothing regret eating and price point are reflective portion size overall agree their pricing fall somewhere yelp google but when you factor in amazing quality relative what you pay agree with yelp s classification value sat kitchen bar and enjoyed watching plating like open kitchen concept since helped optimize what try subsequent visit no regret about eating gnocchi twice and duck steak once during trip however come back next thing would order are sablefish overlooked seafood but one table ordered their entree going assume they know something not and get duck again only mildly curious about rissoto salmon although looked beautiful usually when eat out straight up optimize taste value and am ambivalent dining experience but fable delivered too which must begrudgingly admit won over restaurant manager not only remembered when came back second evening remembered how liked my water can barely get place in seattle recognize go in once every week much le care about my preference non monetary item skipped night eating there and when came back hostess still remembered where like sit service throughout meal attentive without feeling intrusive ambience decor very nice not worked in restaurant before but place generally seemed dynamic engaged and high functioning team e g server double checking plated order before delivering them table everyone in kitchen voicing their opinion what keep thing running well back end there also smaller interaction made feel like staff genuinely cared whether had good experience e g not blanket recommending higher priced daily special when asked their opinion two entree option explicitly reminded not tip by when my bill included gift card hope i ll get visit vancouver again soon because perfect spot unwind and enjoy great food after long day
Fable,fable dine out date visit having previously tried their diner location we very curious try it sibling restaurant we started with fabled virgin blueberry juice pomegranate syrup fresh grapefuit juice soda citrus ginger soda fable made citrus ginger syrup sode which refreshingly tart wife found too sharp we ordered chick pea fritter appetizer which turned out delicious falafel with curry mayo and pickled red onion which lightened otherwise slightly dense dish with their acidity main my wife ordered sqash gnocchi with pork belly extra ordered seared ling cod her squash gnocchi pumpkin seed provided nice crunch dish thats not something ever thought gnocchi needed but we really enjoyed being non protein main nice generous portion also reason added glazed pork belly which also delicious when combined with hazelnut beurre noisette ricotta cheese my ling cod perfectly cooked one side skin nice and crisp but perhaps bit too crisp fish adjacent skin had hardened minor quibble flavour spot mashed potato and cream sauce wasn t listed menu maybe hollandaise harmonized very satisfying dish except portion wise small stole good chunk mr gnocchi keep from starving realize higher end meal fit into smaller budget often lead dine out menu essentially being tasting menu would prefer higher priced but more entree sized main we ordered each dessert initially lemon meringue parfait and sticky date pudding mind blowing lemon meringue parfait with london fog ice cream yes probably from rain shine nearby and taste identical theirs and struesel perfectly balanced lemon curd we ve been hooked trying different sticky pudding since trying gordon ramsey s his steak house in vega often with le than desirable result one good not need ice cream balance whipped marscopone and candied pecan added texture and dimension they tiny they re served in small jar but good we ordered another one each and swapped dessert additional each food highest calibre but we left hungry we assumed portion had been shrunk dine out but turn out their regular portion are small based dine out alone star recommended tiny but perfectly executed dessert gnocchi chick pea fritter avoid arriving empty stomach photo by michelle w
Fable,amazing can make review short no okay i ll go egg benny out world amazing sauce perfectly acidic hate sauce that s just fat with nothing cut through place hyped up damn good reason
Fable,breakfast d real hard during long weekend trip vancouver recently and one few disappointment brunch visit fable service and atmosphere great but food really fell short star how service and atmosphere cozy vibe fable complimented by fast and friendly service really had no complaint star star how portion relative cost got farmer s muffin which essentially open faced breakfast sandwich not unreasonable price point given size dish star star and how food it s thing stayed grounded during my visit fable simply wasn t great dish and wouldn t in my mind been much better served proper breakfast sandwich english muffin fine but nothing special and set tone rest dish egg also nothing special with bit standard cheese and hashbrown soft and squishy opposed crispy peripheral green and jam not much save thing and whole wasn t impressed no star star would you eat every day you could had amazing breakfast experience in vancouver ranging from jam cafe th parallel but fable not quite cut no star
Fable,am personally huge fan fable my favourite go dish gnocchi absolutely amazing such great flavour and texture die they used serve with pulled pork which miss dearly because personally believe combined much better than pork belly their chickpea fritter are another one my favourite everything perfectly balanced out garnish pickled onion and sprout compensate heaviness frying and sauce absolutely delicious you can always count fable everything perfectly cooked like their poached egg always and instagram worthy ooze when you cut into there are only two downside can think first might fact it s pricier side but quality ingredient and effort and detailing given preparation food make cost understandable second sometimes in term flavour dish your order you try switch up from what you usually order might little hit and miss but probably due fact everyone different flavour preference there are many special and menu rotates often and change often sometimes you might fall in love with dish just disappear few month later insert broken heart emoji but least really demonstrates how they focus having freshest most in season ingredient and they re constantly focused finding and showcasing best flavour
Fable,should listened jw marriot concierge when they pretty much ignored my question when asked about restaurant what happens when you are hangry and you just want eat you are regular eater place would just fine you but those are more critical and even want delicious healthy option then go somewhere else really not eat unhealthy processed food my comment food no good quality healthy option service pretty lame our server like zombie but attitude change when bill served only good service we got from hostess place very loud nothing special will not recommend regret went and will not return customer
Fable,we love fable it s our number restaurant go food amazing smaller portion but very high quality ingredient it s worth price
Fable,came saturday morning brunch cozy homey rustic vibe low ceiling and close proximity table made pretty noisy atmosphere waitress recommended scrambled egg and french toast off menu ordered smoked salmon benedict special found benedict luke warm by time came my table and english muffin bit burnt overall found bit sour my taste but salmon pretty fresh hash brown side came with benedict delicious
Fable,came not knowing what getting into and i ll admit best stumble had pleasure stumbling we biking through seaside route we slowly got more and more hungry doing quick google search restaurant in area we settled fable and parked our bike about block away despite being fully booked and during dinner time we able grab two seat bar when we seated guy bar asked we had been there before and later given run menu we had friendly conversation how we could not drink we biking salmon broccolini good my partner said really liked veggie however we agreed spaghetti meatball captured our heart cutting into duck meatball we saw juice come out onto pasta delicious could not hold back my excitement when asked how my meal long story short love place now and want come back again try rest their dish great service and amazing food
Fable,turned out blessing in disguise our initial yelp find had u in long line u stayed and went check out another option no wait and farm table done deal service very friendly and server provided suggestion had my first ceasar canadian form bloody mary loved seasoning and flavor food we ordered made each person eager share piece their meal and each taste supported another reason come back another time pork shoulder bennie cornbread base hollaindaise amazing pork moist and flavorful had barbeque sauce which hesitant about but worked wes s meatball skillet reminded meatball shop in ny meatball moist and tasty with italian flavor in sauce added bonus our sweet tooth son had his french toast which enjoyed by no syrup needed johnny cake similar except my daughter s pancake had cornmeal base oh moist and had softness pancake there tasty shredded pork top yum yum would we come back definite yup yup
Fable,fable kitchen renowned canadian restaurant run by trevor bird and must say soaring higher level than run mill restaurant wait long seated establishment however because it extraordinariness might good make reservation simply wait seat open up by taking walk around kit commercial neighbourhood we ordered four their evening dish chickpea fritter canned tuna crispy pork rib and pan seared gnocchi dish exceedingly tasteful elegant and novel chickpea fritter appeared simple falafel but much much more potato like and crispy texture complemented by it golden sauce and crisp fresh herb topping gone in two bite needle say canned tuna anything but and can t help but appreciate effective and comedic use irony consisted fried bread and gourmet fish dipping combination hit with u and almost immediately eaten entirely mostly by like eating luxury tuna luxury rice that s good thing and not even gotten rib but when gone in instant whatever sweet nectar like sauce addicting flavour could not get enough basil surprisingly went well with rib and tender savoury bean excellent complement sweet crispy rib last but not least gnocchi indeed non traditional but exceptional melt away expectation pair excellently with smooth white cream and yellow squash pur e form triage comfort and indelible soothing softness round out already wholesome dish soft pumpkin seed and seared kale are added fray complete dish my first time fable not expecting anything yet blown away by culinary experience not only food great but service not mention washroom clean and spacious with subtle lighting perfect one those bathroom selfies course restaurant great photo wooden beam and red brick make vibrant background i ll still rate five star because masterful food portion are surprisingly french sized e smaller than what will sate person with hearty appetite look forward trying fable again with bated breath
Fable,went fable lunch friday with my husband around pm and literally there not another single person in place surprised but also meant we got pick seat and full attention staff which really nice soooo excited see they had croque madam menu one my favorite warm cheesy with egg sandwich amazing loved had pickled onion with two beautifully soft egg top and bacon jam with ham inside had parmesan foam well and wasn t sure what going like but amazing definite must try like sweet and savoury breakfast sandwich my husband not much but still really enjoyed taste and flavour combination accompanied with simple fricasee salad fresh and had light oil and vinegar dressing happy we tried place lunch now we ll come back dinner

Fable,came brunch with friend food got salmon egg benny and we shared french toast salmon very fresh and benny good overall but not think my style food french toast though another story toast huge with lot different fruit and topping and texture very chewy and sweet which really enjoyed service our server very impatient about giving u time order we said we needed minute few time and always gave u few second before coming back haha but then during meal when we needed service no where found ambience liked design place very dark and artistic but table very small crowded and therefore very loud
Fable,came weekday during winter holiday lunch with group friend place pretty much empty we able get table quickly but fill up pretty quickly closer noon ambience casual and service top notch our server attentive patient and gave good recommendation food overall food saltier side appetizer and vegetable are small medium sized and good sharing definitely recommend brussel sprout crispy brussel sprout with good crunch outside not overly oily rest dish saltier side but seasoned perfectly pistachio added good crunnchhh king oyster mushroom little heavy parmesan side my personal taste but mushroom very fresh meh spaghetti meatball duck wayyy too salty cream pasta sauce pretty rich with good flavor but flavor overshadowed by salt meatball slightly overcooked duck meat and again very salty think they made few smaller meatball instead one large meatball may cook more evenly drink caesar decent pretty standard overall good experience and would go back again try their brunch menu but beware salty dish

Fable,fantastic spot bite eat hollondaise sauce egg benny die cozy homey atmosphere with fairly small local selection make place absolute gem wait food can little bit high you arrive opening but quality food more than male up
Fable,food and service pretty good bit expensive because farm table aspect organic ethically raised local but expected people left review portion size small they small but expected level dining enjoyed cornbread appetizer and main course and too full dessert there really wasn t much particularly memorable about food good but not great which reason can t give more than star remember drink sounded really unique and not loaded with mix syrup which important but they weren t strong would liked appreciate although they out cranberry juice drink ordered they suggested get with local blueberry juice instead nice rather than them saying drink altogether unavailable also ordered wine with my main course and waitress told my choice not suited meal had ordered and suggested few others try trusted her opinion and tried one her suggestion but unfortunately wasn t my taste i m type person embarrassed not know much about wine too shy ask something else totally not waitress appreciate her effort help out with pairing though location great and food decent i ll likely back

Fable,sparksnotes review you what get meatball and spaghetti beet dish what avoid not tell them you are vegan especially you are not really vegan okay longer explanation listen we deserve good food but sometimes we not want shell out cash truth told place expensive but their appetizer are affordable and delicious spaghetti and meatball blew my mind parmesan foam such perfect cloud salty goodness managed infuse every bite had must my in debt saving big trip saving big house friend out there essentially everyone beet dish also delight creative and almond sauce like nothing ever tasted before my one complaint potato dish given my vegan friend like try eating vegan but isnt strict got roasted potato and they lame long story short stick menu folk lot people raved about chickpea fritter falafel type thing and cant say would order them again they good but they had very smooth consistency in center which am not used honest guess am more traditional in sense otherwise great service and good vibe will back
Fable,i ve had place in my bookmark long time and not remember there anyway today decide try without making reservation we arrived there and there couple people in front u waiting table would take really long available we decided seat bar and we ended up waiting minute not bad someone not reservation menu had lot attracting option decided gnocchi onion with pulled pork main course dish just m z n g good and very filling everything well done and onion part gave much taste dish not starter and almost refusing dessert which not dessert had strawberry shortcake parfait and mixture had interesting taste liked lot besides had delicious cocktail which name had word kiss in but not remember full name p location very easy staff great and restaurant nice and clean definitely plan go back and try their brunch menu

Fable,delicious outstanding inventive food very attentive and well informed staff definitely would recommend
Fable,excellent dining experience no fuss quick service small menu knowledgeable and very attentive staff and food we started with cornbread with special flavoured butter which moist and addictive then came canned tuna institutional landmark dish with good reason flavourful and rich but never cloying then we had scallop and pork belly and special night seated need heart in black pepper jelly cooked and seasoned perfection and came with nice refreshing salad counterbalance umami and richness finished with shared dessert poached rhubarb with ginger cake custard and lavender ice cream we stuffed and happily would return in heartbeat and recommend friend overall our meal came just over no drink but completely worth
Fable,must canadian brunch parking breeze in residence but sure leave car s length gap your car and stop sign double check permit pulled pork pancake dream and egg benedict with ham amazing savory sweet spicy from picked jalapeno just worked and compressed hasbrown properly elevated mcdonalds hashbrown farm table ham in benedict easy chew and not salty like ham in u great meal and subtly different from what i ve had in past
Fable,beautifully and creatively plated food isn t dainty you finish your dish hungry brunch highly recommend scrambled egg which come in mason jar and creamy and delicious house made brioche jam and ketchup give dish extra point dinner onion gnocchi divine plump piece dense gnocchi mop up creamy soubise and pesto sauce like work magic roasted veggie balance out dish in texture and esthetic add tender pulled pork and you ve got yourself real winner dessert would advise against lemon meringue parfait meringue much much too sweet even my sweet tooth bottom line would come back brunch and dinner
Fable,came dine out and excited finally chance eat service fine presentation food great but sadly not find enjoyed food much least option personally ordered like what my friend got since we had party three we able try almost dine out item got good range what they offer only thing we not lamb shoulder appetizer wise got chickpea fritter upon our server s recommendation but found them way too salty green top nicely seasoned crunchy and fresh though which nice contrast fritter themselves though found my friend s roasted squash salad much more my liking though sometimes contrast in flavor not quite meld felt wanting entree got paella again waaay too salty bit oily seafood little overcooked and flavor bit too acidic maybe due tomato everything cooked just fine and portion size good though my friend s mushroom cavatelli with short rib very tasty though wish had gotten instead basically licked her plate clean would too haha dessert got lemon meringue parfait ok top tasted more like burnt marshmellow than light meringue lemon curd nice but only couple small spoonful worth and there few tiny cookie bit in there well but i m pretty sure they forgot ice cream sad but definitely liked squash cake my friend got much much better presentation fun there good contrast flavor texture and just really good drink wise got wake up bit too sour and my friend got drink but wasn t my fav either overall i m glad finally got see what fable about and dine out gave great chance admittedly expecting much more especially from what i ve heard about service and food neither which particularly impressed by but still good time with good friend
Fable,fable solid dining option but dish pale in comparison farm table option such farmer s apprentice forage and oakwood bistro spinach egg benedict wasn t fan overly tangy hollandaise sauce dish miss cavatelli with mushroom flavor good but portion very small wouldn t mind paying quality pasta but dish not justify price tag we also opted add pork belly but kitchen forgot add meat initially and then they brought pork belly over separately different plate pork belly not add dish
Fable,during our trip vancouver hoping dinner embodied canadian vancouver cuisine which chose eat appreciate their emphasis farm table and using local ingredient highlight region s resource place narrow and feel bit crowded but really like because warm and cozy feel also service great most importantly food great price are little high and people might think portion are small but think entree are big enough leave you feeling satisfied without feeling too full and price reasonable quality one thing really like about each dish everything plate add dish whole rather than adding anything afterthought filler every veggie and sauce contributes dish enjoyed sauce much made sure sop up much possible with each and every bite we started off with appetizer chickpea fritter and tagliatelle and meatball fritter and meatball slightly denser than expected but still moist enough and tasty loved tangy curried mayo and pea shoot fritter and app parmesan foam light and had strong parmesan flavor though suggest eating foam quickly before dissolve tagliatelle had good chew too we shared entree smoked duck butcher s cut beef chuck wild bc salmon and gnocchi with pulled pork loved sweet smokey flavor duck just wish le chewy and skin more crispy few bit crispy skin great they great job lightly cooking salmon because rare in middle but cooked enough moist and very easy cut through would ve liked more seasoning salmon but risotto like barley and toasted pumpkin seed delicious pulled pork seemed like strange pairing with gnocchi and very sweet but really liked mushroom and onion sauce really good gnocchi gnocchi are like really large long pillow creamy potato perfect soaking up delicious oniony sauce butcher s cut day chuck roast sou vided hour only came with chunk meat but meat absolutely tender and thick dark jam smeared onto plate sweet and incredible small block potato great too because it s crispy outside and creamy inside finally we finished our meal with smores burnt marshmallow topping pretty much tasted like smores and great bite marshmallow ice cream and crunchy cookie once however dessert very sweet and not seem innovative everything else we had it s not must order overall our dinner fantastic and really feel like got taste what vancouver offer value good in term price versus quality and each dish seems very carefully thought out and put together highlight night curried mayo from fritter app barley risotto and pumpkin seed from salmon dish onion sauce with gnocchi and thick sweet sauce chuck roast plate
Fable,food service ambiance came brunch before hitting up khatsalano fest we shared french toast mascarpone candied walnut seasonal preserve and fresh berry and special day open faced breakfast sandwich with bacon tomato red onion sunny side egg with side salad and hashbrown french toast delicious edge toast reminds center cinnamon bun best part very dense and rich but mascarpone and tartness from berry help cut sweetness sotd also really good hashbrown winner two dish shared two u perfect amount food also had grapefruit mimosa anna spinato organic prosecco which served tableside i ve never seen done way before which really refreshing i d interested in comnig back check out their dinner service
Fable,say food really good my favorite appetizer far can tuna yes name sound cheap but it not it basically albacore tuna with extra work my end mushing and stabbing you will know what mean when you order but it yummy their cracker bread wish bread cracker le hole in also got chickpea fritter yummy but would say tuna definitely star and chickpea fritter it about main course ordered wild salmon and eye enlightened really good love mint and beet puree yummy last but not least desert famous s more well desert ok would definitely come back again

Fable,delicious farm table dining great service lovely space good food we got in order how much we liked them chickpea fritter roasted bc king oyster mushroom benny day bacon and pasta day bonus we got table closest kitchen we could see end stage food being prepared fun too would definitely recommend you re in kitsilano area
Fable,good wait staff ambience ingredient but prep left something desired benedict missing salt scrambled egg had glorious parm foam but egg tough and bit leathery home made sausage pretty good but not worth hype black pepper jam great concept pretty innovative but tad too heavy soy sauce which gave off aftertaste not bad place eat but not worth hype price and wait
Fable,wow one better meal i ve had year two u ordered chick pea fritter octopus salad mushroom p gnocchi and duck plus goat cheese cheesecake dessert everything delicious highly recommended go

Fable,love name fable from farm table brilliant we had called ahead time table adult and baby when we got there high chair along with child s menu already set up along with adult chair service absolutely fantastic from beginning end staff friendly courteous and most importantly happy food indeed fresh inventive and delicious wild mushroom risotto creamy flavorful and cooked well world s best canned tuna wasn t impressed and price isn t worth presentation nice though flat iron steak best flat iron steak i ve had tender well seasoned succulent and perfect medium rare drink small side ordered cocktail but they looked only little bigger than shot glass with very little alcohol even with these minor issue loved

Fable,we had mussel appy with fry nice thick cut potato wedge fry with good crispy exterior and moist interior mussel served plate not traditional bowl really large mussel also had octopus fennel and bacon overall seemed bit heavy appy just combo heavy item may work better shared main duck breast excellent crispy skin moist and juicy with very nice mustard and carrot purree unfortunately pork not great unlike duck pork not juicy fatty side but flavouring not carry through rest meat nice thinly sliced apple which onion not match they le eloquently cut sp tzle really nice overall would not recommend pork cocktail wise amaretto sour and elderflower fizz excellent very friendly staff and highly skilled bill ninja d away from during very brief visit washroom well played fable
Fable,soon you walk in lunch you feel buzz greeter energetic smile even though we arrived quite late our reservation seated right away and waiter showed up right cue and time welcome u we went with benny day with pulled pork slow cooked perfect tenderness tad more sauce would been nice but no complaint also tried their creamy tomato soup which very nice rainy day we had place s motto from farm table and freshness well appreciated each bread each salad leaf and each egg delightful shall return their dinner menu time job well done
Fable,food good you could really taste quality ingredient however nothing super amazing service also bit slow and waitstaff not attentive
Fable,my rating fable farm table nice restaurant name got excited when saw high rating yelp but after my visit felt like slightly overrated best canned tuna diced tuna topped with layer potato puree and olive oil which you mix together in jar and spread toasted brioche like texture it s smooth spread but still chunk tuna giving chewiness tasted slightly creamy but lacked bit flavor interesting but wasn t much my liking and overpriced what you get spaghetti and meatball giant duck meat ball served with tagliatelle and mushroom topped with parmesan whip parmesan whip amazing really creamy and strong in cheese flavor mixed really well with pasta flavor waiter mentioned when you cut duck meat ball juice would burst out which not really happen slightly disappointed meat slightly dry not moist thought would onion gnocchi added pulled pork pan seared gnocchi with burnt onion and fresh mixed vegetable topped with pulled pork pulled pork meat soft and tender but felt like sauce not blend too well with gnocchi gnocchi piece thick dense but soft and creamy and tasted great with pesto sauce flavor point loved fresh ingredient in dish tomato vegetable green really tasty and delicious not get wrong food delicious really like decor and atmosphere place service great too

Fable,only reason go fable their decadent spaghetti meatball and antoine s outstanding service you ll find sump up my previous visit there first visit we showed up without reservation and seated bar which nice antoine gave u best service possible described u every single item menu and his best help find meal would fit my onion intolerance which can hard sometimes appetizer right suggest spaghetti meatball they by far best thing menu star we also had octopus salad but dressing and sunchoke very yummy octopus chewy which disappoint since really like octopus star main course we picked most expensive dish menu halibut and moroccan lamb but such disappointment star moroccan lamb spicy spicy proof tongue my boyfriend almost could not handle halibut dry we could not believe had been cooked with sou vide process supposed keep moisture evenly big time disappointment antoine saw our face and without second thought took our plate and gave u menu pick something else because just wanted u like what we eat also removed main dish from bill we wanted play safe time and took another meatball we liked much food star service star antoine but we think there way too many waiter seating capacity and number client ambience atmosphere star it s nice place and general atmosphere good but sooooo noisy and since staff just keep running it s kind hard relax space decor star again it s really nice but it s tiny you feel back and forth staff in back your seat price star meatball s price worth but main dish definitely not first visit rating star second visit we arrived pm without reservation and scared we wouldn t able eat since restaurant close pm however owner reassured u saying every person coming restaurant welcome eat long set foot before pm we guided our table antoine from behind bar saw u and greeted u well that s always nice main course without moment hesitation my boyfriend and ordered not not but meatball word spread quite fast in restaurant since antoine not our waiter and another waiter not hesitate tease u about ambience friendly and we liked hearty savoury and just unique sum up about these decadent meatball food star service star many people remembered u which great but we found our waitress bit pushy bringing bill bit too soon her defence i d say restaurant officially closed when brought but still many many still eating ambience atmosphere star good friendly atmosphere but like last time place very noisy space decor star time we seated table we bar last time but i m sorry say they are very close each you feel little bit into your neighbour conversation price star second visit rating star going back without doubt
Fable,great atmosphere amazing food few item we tried brunch menu delicious recommend egg benedict and pulled pork pancake also bloody mary one best i ve ever had
Fable,unfortunately fairly large group seated time with u small child sometimes running around and screaming not quite what expecting friday night dinner th ave price point person our server quite honest and apologized delay our service due large group comp d appetizer dish which very generous think took almost min get our apps and maybe almost hour our main by time main finally came out had already lost my appetite from waiting also my duck breast rare side i m guessing because kitchen rushed catch up our order honestly would preferred eating somewhere else hostess accepted my reso told there wasn t availability my time slot because there large group our server however offer gift certificate come back which again very generous but i m not sure would go back alot hype restaurant but weak execution
Fable,very impressed with place had french toast and added side sausage sausage very tender and not dry overly fatty french toast with berry compote and pecan delicious truly hit hit spot service outstanding my coffee and water never le than half full value there and left with full belly and smile my face
Fable,we called and tried make reservation dinner but they unfortunately booked and told we can show up when they open pm and just walk in because good review we took our chance and showed up pm there small line up but we managed get table and informed by polite receptionist we can stay til pm which long enough finish our meal place really nice and cozy it s bit small but well designed and clean lighting good too our server very friendly and gave u brief orientation what restaurant about followed by introduction their dinner special and few suggestion well very attentive despite how busy place we got foie gras and octopus salad start foie gras came in mason jar with sort apple jam and duck skin crumble top also served with few piece bread really delicious octopus salad star had light char and went very well with bacon and hummus just simply explosion great flavour main we got flat iron steak and butcher s cut meat perfectly cooked and served with green mushroom and black pepperjam sauce also tried their cocktail called kiss from rose which light and refreshing unfortunately we had no room dessert but should not long our next visit what excellent dining experience will definitely come back more

Fable,delicious farm table food with fresh seasonal ingredient decent portion size and reasonable price one my favorite restaurant recent trip in vancouver and i d definitely recommend and also would come back again come with people you can order few plate share we started out with cornbread piece which came out warm and good but not absolute must bit fluffier side almost more like cake i ve had cornbread blow out water would pas and save room something else off menu chickpea fritter there little fritter which delicious with curry mayo pickled onion and green they not skimp topping and fritter paired really well with curry flavor you not like curry you ll want skip dish since it s pretty spice intensive really liked and easy share ling cod also delicious with homemade duck sausage and squash puree fish fresh and flaky you like white fish you ll like dish onion gnocchi there s option add pulled pork and waiter nice enough let u add sou vide stiletto steak instead we could try i m sure pulled pork would equally delicious since you can t go wrong with pulled pork gnocchi one best i ve had fluffy and everything good gnocchi should with onion and pesto everyone enjoyed every bite smoked duck breast not usually love duck much but done right smoky but not salty with sweet apple puree and quinoa paired perfectly with would order again in heartbeat everything really delicious fresh and unique i d come back again dinner try more their dish good number people come with since appetizer and main are not quite big enough shared with party larger than we not get dessert because we went next door rain shine they close pm make reservation ahead time place can get busy we able get last minute reservation sunday night by calling in during afternoon plan ahead i m sure friday and saturday night are crazy i d love come back again
Fable,intense flavor fantastic presentation cool vibe came dinner weeknight and place moderately filled staff friendly and straight forward wasn t sure what wanted eat and my waiter very good describing menu concise ended up getting sold special night spotted shrimp with thick piece bacon along with fixing aroma dish made melt in my seat flavor blended together well they controlled bacon awesomeness wouldn t overpower ingredient will return then next time i m in vancouver
Fable,excellent food went dinner had mushroom gnocchi and perfect except added bacon pancetta and crazy thick cuz block bacon which delicious but little overwhelming loved staff had french waiter super informative and kept cracking corny joke but really brightened up our dinner place dark and intimate nice romantic evening but just went with friend cocktail solid well but not groundbreaking anyway will def return can really liked my experience
Fable,love new american cuisine during my recent trip vancouver had see what new canadian food about and am glad tried fable everything cooked deliciously ingredient balanced with richness and freshness service great and dinner priced reasonably we made reservation friday night and hostess informed u we had out within hour little confused because i m typically quick eater once food hit table snap my photo and then food in my belly dining experience enjoyable not even realize we there almost hour menu isn t very extensive maybe about dish total appetizer entree and dessert there also prix fixe menu just lot cocktail choose from no whiskey only gin and vodka and also non alcoholic mocktails people we pretty much ordered half menu option enjoyed every dish and overly stuffed here s run my favorite dish canned tuna house cured tuna in jar with herb potato and oil it s mashed together and spread crusty bread must try you enjoy cured meat like tomato soup paired perfectly with onion grilled cheese sandwich sammie served shallow bowl and soup poured table from tea pot soup nice and thick but not overly acidic butcher s cut special evening sou vide chuck steak hour there only two slice steak cut very thick wish there more steak super tender and paired perfectly with black pepper jam little kick shiitake mushroom and bok choy roasted duck two such hearty meal with crispy brussels sprout lentil and spicy chorizo and broccolini duck skin sweet and crispy and meat tender we could comb out with just fork s more texture homemade brownie good balance crispy like edge and soft like cake portion wasn t overly rich from brownie and chocolate ice cream and meringue soft and creamy lemon parfait too sour but enjoyed london fog ice cream and streusel crunch dish probably could done without rustic loaf with garlic and parmesan butter butter wasn t garlicky cheesy enough and duck meatball nothing special highly recommend give fable try
Fable,we very excited come breakfast lunch dinner just looked great we opted dinner dining room busy noisy and cramped tuesday evening around oh well it s popular drink good house focaccia with roasted black pepper butter standout we each ordered appetizer and entree big mistake more later first course beet and burrata and octopus guess we weren t expecting these overly salad y but they and they pretty big like dinner salad load green very tasty then came main pea gnocchi with bacon my wife and scallop and pork belly gnocchi in quote because these aren t gnocchi they re more like big british dumpling bacon and pork belly are in quote because they thing in each dish exact thing far we could tell wasn t problem u we love big chunk fried pork belly bacon just weird they called two different thing maybe one smoked and wasn t but smoking not work main also loaded with green heavy crisp lightly cooked garden green like kale mustard green etc they delicious but man oh man someone should warn people they might good with just first second course maybe two first and entree share serious green overload normally i m begging find good green traveling they are definitely just know they re in large quantity service wasn t spectacular little rushed but busy i d try place again but maybe breakfast instead

Fable,third time and wasn t disappointed although wasn t totally impressed either atmosphere casual and pretty hip they went in with farm table aesthetic their food focus no complaint about service had ling cod with celeriac remoulade cod had great consistency and just dry and tender enough enjoyable celeriac base provided drastic but interesting contrast cod perhaps little too powerful my liking cod serving quite small price in my opinion but what there certainly great good work once again fable
Fable,food really good and service good too ordered chick pea fritter rutabaga tagliatelle with mushroom sauce and brownie dessert they good except when ordered black tea and took sip bad looked and tea bag twining they could use better quality tea go well with their dessert but will go back
Fable,went in with high expectation but unfortunately aside from cornbread meal rather bland and lacking ordered bc salmon and my friend got duck each lightly seasoned and not bring out flavor love dear in my favorite fish cabbage highlight accent my dish but aside from not understand what hype about got gnocchi go and much better felt like drowned with too much flavor but least had you i d spend your time elsewhere
Fable,just before entering restaurant our group ran into christopher from gilmore girl fact meal best part evening say lot fact too happily distracted take food pic my favourite appy been charcuterie plate but not see menu time we had octopus salad and canned tuna unanimously octopus salad adored we decided share duck salmon and potato encrusted chicken next time am sticking with salmon and chicken duck quite good but two extraordinary accompaniment salmon blew our mind and cooked perfectly according fish expert table chicken like comfort food but upgraded had kiss from rose cocktail and mighty satisfied note our recent visit we had planned eating somewhere else not take reservation and ended up being closed th restaurant in area we tried and we exhausted and famished staff went extra effort get u in and wasn t long wait we will bringing back friend they can try out accommodating and delicious spot

Fable,good intention not make food taste better place get spin being about feel good food although seems like canada and responsible farm table eating then wonder can t aging meat considered natural adding salt not overcooking my steak our waitstaffer had fierce red lip but her treatment u bit dismissive and slick it s great could keep many ball in air but one ball we felt no love
Fable,solid dinner fare staff can bit strangely loud not need you yell what food in my face but food delicious love menu change occasionally space comfortable and clean but little dark enjoyed everything i ve tried definitely recommend

Fable,reason picked place try coz saw top chef canada and know about trevor bird view menu online and find food selection are limited and not attractive my gal friend eats like bird therefore we shared everything we ordered duck meat ball in fettuccine creative starter meat ball tasty and tender but fettuccine bit blend flat iron steak steak cooked perfectly sable fish delicious and smooth opera torte hazelnut and chocolate cake good and espresso ice cream tasted excellent would say great place casual dinner with such reasonable price

Fable,solid star we came my sweetie s birthday fable farm table restaurant caters more yuppy crowd place very busy would highly recommend making resos ahead time we called one week in advance and let them know birthday occasion we started off with duck basket appetizer and had ling cod and smoked duck breast entree duck basket appetizer consists many random part duck many people may not typically eat such gizzard neck and wing sauce tasted lot like sweet and sour pork good but not exactly what we expecting ling cod cooked well with delicate fluffy texture and accompanying veggie delicious smoked duck breast very good presentation and taste appealing but amount sauce bit overwhelming overall we enjoyed food but service average likely due filled capacity restaurant
Fable,fable seasonal menu which tie in with farm table concept my boyfriend went with their butcher s cut special went their lamb and cod option and then we decided try their cornbread which they offered instead traditional bread basket i m happy report pleasantly surprised when food arrived cornbread best cornbread i ve ever had when think cornbread think something that s dense and possibly dry however cornbread moist and full corn flavor served with honey butter which tempted just eat without bread lamb cod lamb incredibly tender and delicious however wasn t fan lamb and cod combination two flavor and texture just not work together star dish though tomato stew base underneath protein flavorful and rich helped blend component together and with every bite you get punch cumin face with their dukkah mix herb and spice in summary restaurant nice surprise lot place use these key phrase like farm table try market themselves kind revolutionary one kind restaurant however fable actually stepped up plate and delivered definitely recommend coming because it s got unique menu something everyone my full review fable and restaurant visit http cassiexiong com fable

Fable,updated review my second visit fable my first visit not great but had wanted back and finally got chance today say am very glad returned completely bowled over by food had onion gnocchi and my husband had halibut in kind tomato sauce thought they delicious and portion generous gnocchi my favourite in term presentation and way complicated flavour came together very well done my husband thought sauce halibut dish bit too strong but loved and agreed overall very good canned tuna starter very tasty well overall great experience which got even better when we ordered smores dessert we had plan go rain shine icecream afterwards but we saw table next u order and decided go we not regret our choice server bit pushy and asked my husband done thrice we also got wrong check first time but quick correct food win am fan and hope return try thing their menu older review star okay can see place great review but my experience not match we stumbled upon place after getting ice cream rain and shine next door and decided make quick dinner stop because friend had raved about luckily they had table two and we quickly seated our server took time explain special u and listed price well but came off bit rehearsed script we tried tell him we not eat red meat but continued which wasn t too bad just bit textbook had glass red wine and brought taste before confirmed order very nice ordered roasted duck breast requested well done matter preference but server told already smoked better medium rare and insisted accepted reluctantly dish okay but would preferred well done and wish had insisted back quinoa and nut bed came sweeter side and felt bit like breakfast cereal my husband had salmon collar taco which special appetizer but server told u shared plate and could main my husband went because intrigued by it novelty unfortunately bit strange make taco with lettuce leaf felt you call taco maybe tortilla would better accompaniment overall not impressed by food however after scanning through review feel we ordered wrong stuff would tried dessert had we not had ice cream before would visit again am in vicinity brunch because liked ambience and their menu option look interesting concept farm table also great idea
Fable,read these phenomenal review and boy excited check place out went lunch which only reason will try place one more time dinner because lunch menu tiny goodness decor very nice rustic but clean and not pubby service server attentive and polite they made error with my order and promptly resolved and then took plate off my bill happy badness food took first bite and thought oily and salty but delicious half way through meal my gallbladder and liver seizing up wiped sweat off my brow and glanced with blurred vision aed incase someone heart attack seriously though there six people our table and unanimous opinion food too salty and greasy and really that s only issue but i m going there food it s not up par then i m left sitting uncushioned chair thinking master cleanse i m going start following day
Fable,food decent and love farm table concept waiter also french and hilarious we stood in line maybe minute before getting spot it s definitely vancouver favourite however portion soooo small we had order multiple entree before we full we probably wouldn t choose go more experience you know will stable and decent no sock blown off
Fable,vegan friendly however there only one main course dish menu could made vegan server very kindly took care my order and told they could switch out certain thing make non vegan dish vegan beet root tartar delicious well zucchini tagliatelle everything great except they little too salty in my opinion since eat whole food plant based low salt and oil diet could just my personal acquired taste though however my family are not vegan also found too salty great service though
Fable,went there early and wasn t too busy had canned tuna and only ok everyone said awesome but not think too much had duck breast dish which delish steak meal average ok price not crazy expensive but not cheap either
Fable,my third time fable and they ve been brunch my main critique portion size not big time we had wait around my parent show up my wife and silently watched line prepare every item menu after watching everything made with such care and quality ingredient could not wait order got ham benny usual and super impressed egg cooked perfectly hollandaise had perfect consistency and ham awesome thinly sliced and piled opposed thick slab coffee excellent roast had and banana bread amongst best i ve ever had we told they only bake batch once per month we lucked out it s funny one those place i m glad never reviewed because only got better each time went
Fable,lot research before my recent trip vancouver and narrowed dinner my first night fable and tableau bar bistro woman my hotel s front desk convinced go with fable coming from san francisco interested see how food would top chef canada restaurant overall really enjoyed ambiance and service excellent waitress friendly helpful and attentive started with heirloom tomato salad with ricotta cucumber and honey thyme vinegarette highlight cheese and dish had most flavor everything ordered next had slow cooked salmon with carrot puree and summer cassoulet and say pretty bland and flavorless and not wild about consistency salmon tempted lemon meringue parfait based review site but looking something not overly sweet waitress recommended blueberry lavender tart and kitchen great and substituted tarragon ice cream buttermilk ice cream ok but not lot flavor sampled couple red wine and ended up trying two different b c red which excellent entire meal cost little over including tip which felt high side relative quality food perhaps living in san francisco really high expectation but would not return given option
Fable,my friend and not disappointed in our choice tonight dinner we decided last minute dine fable called ahead ass chance getting table pm hostess phone nice enough say it s busy but had room bar now and table will come available in min we decided try either option luckily bar spot still available when we got there we truly enjoyed our spot bar by serving station not too sure would like being in seat by door though too many people standing behind you waiting their seat anyhow we enjoyed watching chef expediting order and not being crowded by diner around u we started off with canned tuna recommended by reviewer we truly enjoyed warned it small portion great you aren t sharing suggest not sharing cause it good my friend had gnocchi with pulled pork and had duck great choice encouraged my friend not like duck try my duck pleasantly surprised how lean they ve done great job trimming away fat and left tasty medium rare meat plate my friend s gnocchi hearty and full flavour stuffed and had take rest home with bottle and half litre wine with our meal we stuffed and unfortunately not room dessert even though what we saw liked delicious service attentive not pretentious one reviewer also noted atmosphere relax and also noticed diner taking time thank staff great meal fable definite must try

Fable,am regular and usually think food great but staff horrible they treat their client child vibe older staff member can t catch up with their younger more successful client they treat them like shit mean young lawyer business professional and doctor go from nearby professional tower just like staff screwed up in life and can t handle their client are younger far more successful than they are and smarter than they are just bring my coffee and not tell sad story about how you and you never went college and had your baby
Fable,food awesome host very cheery and welcoming and our service throughout our meal impeccable ordered pulled pork johnny cake would definitely recommend someone want sweet and savory their breakfast my husband ordered steak and egg and steak perfectly cooked my mom initially sat in syrup stained seat and staff offered her new seat immediately well offered her help with her dry cleaning wanted overall small bumpy start our meal very quickly resolved and followed by awesome meal would come back food and especially service

Fable,had ok nice meal but thankfully not pay we shared th least expensive bottle red wine one appy and main each and our total before tip bread not provided you pay extra and our slice le than high thick and long similar in shape and size fingerling potato part probably most egregious
Fable,loved every aspect dining fable from service friendly knowledgeable and helpful wait staff ambiance food had tomato soup first course which came with mini grilled cheese sandwich in center bowl i m not normally creamy soup fan but in combination with sandwich and warm bread bun dipping great highlight entree gnocchi onion with pulled pork one best dish i ve ever had interesting mixture flavor and everything cooked and seasoned perfectly my girlfriend had salmon which great in it right but could not stop picking gnocchi off my plate dessert we had oops dropped dessert upside waffle cone simulating unfortunate ice cream accident we hoping more rhubarb since featured in description but focused blueberry ice cream and relegated rhubarb paste side still not disappoint and finished off amazing meal u highly recommend fable anyone looking creative dish in upscale but not stuffy environment
Fable,got salmon egg benedict special and friend got farmer s market had goat cheese cooked salmon egg and hollandaise watching them make food from their open kitchen really fun they squeeze their very awesome hollandaise out whipped cream canister salmon portion very generous and egg poached very soft and wonderfully their hashbrown with sour cream incredible and they also leafy green vinaigrette complete meal service attentive and ambience wonderful one problem with bar legroom incredibly minimal bit uncomfortable long leg would definitely come back

Fable,had two meal truly consider best meal dining experience my life far and my dinner fable last week sure one them good my friend and showed up dinner around pm without reservation but we still got table within half hour however i d recommend making reservation especially you more than two people in your party because from what we could tell place get really busy they also not wait list keep your place in waiting table queue you should just stick around hostess very nice about though even though there nonstop stream reservationless people coming in time and crowding front restaurant our server claude enthusiastic and hilarious friendly and made entire experience more awesome but food real star we ordered cornbread because being from southern united state am big fan cornbread one not disappoint come in four wedge and lightly toasted and served with most insanely tasty honey butter yourself favor and order cornbread it s menu got one pasta special with sea bean broccolini and pickled morel pickled morel little much and ended up kind shoving them one side but rest delicious ate in very quick and unflattering way and not care my friend got gnocchi with pesto and though really enjoyed i ll warn you gnocchi isn t your traditional kind these huge pillowy gnocchi resembled giant marshmallow you toast over campfire s more but said still good may snuck bite what not skip dessert get lemon meringue dessert s more one get you re true winner not normally like pudding and custard and whatnot but these decadent and delicious my friend and polished them off with no trouble i ve never had meringue soft and toasty how they witchcraft probably in case you re wondering one shiro s in seattle
Fable,two word pork platter incredible food and knowledgeable attentive service really liked server listened what we saying and responded our question then politely offered choice when appropriate think people just want show off their companion and their ego stroked by server and isn t remotely their function it s unfortunate reviewer seem had experience but after visit over two year am very surprised hear about fable because never been my experience not listen you try place can t think vancouver restaurant focus farm table with level food and service these price and isn t remotely pretentious really really excellent value they also take reservation but not prime time like pm ish fri and sat they can also accommodate walk in in word variety patron nice go fable power yelp compels you

Fable,had heard good thing about fable and finally went dinner one night with small group friend most u underwhelmed with our food not outright disappointed service decent hostess and waitress friendly enough accommodate special drink order but after being initially pleased they offered check our coat we found out they merely hung our stuff over restaurant random hook and ladder wall had valuable expensive coat would ve been alarmed since anyone could easily snatch their way out door our jacket weren t even hung near our table food such let see from many rave review brunch seems more popular dining option fable but we had dinner started with generously sized octopus salad but octopus chewy hell sauce dressing nearly nonexistent romanesco billed menu also had mussel ove mussel but could not even finish dish how you screw up mussel thank goodness not order fry accompany because sauce had zero flavour about half dozen mussel weren t even open which rendered them inedible and grilled bread came with charred could smell how burnt three my friend also could not finish their plate duck apparently too tough eat these price serving pretty basic comfort food should not much miss and small bit bread with butter should not extra charge ambience cozy but loud might too cramped you had large group people
Fable,service and experience well it price range first course tasted great but main course seemed like they trying too hard and not live up expectation however dessert great which wonderful finish
Fable,came sunday brunch fill up fast they open and are full by we arrived group and seated right away service excellent our coffee always filled party are not seated are present staff very nice genuine friendly decor cozy clean modern clean washroom food had omelette came with side roasted potato perfectly warm and soft inside crispy outside omelette little greasy in puddle oil but might been from melted cheese you like greasy then perfect loved chunky crispy thick cut bacon top rustic bread toasted perfectly friend ordered kale with pulled pork daily special really tender pork good portion meat scrambled egg not try but came in mason jar told good sunday drink menu last sunday month only what we really came drink are very very affordable and delicious slutty farmhen fruity shot with jager and juice mimosa choice grapefruit orange had grapefruit you can actually taste alcohol in one place not put enough and just taste like juice not draft beer gypsy tear from parallel quite good hoppy but not too bitter good you like hop id come back brunch entree actually taste fresh and good good portion fairly priced drink im fan
Fable,oh no really hoping enjoy fable concept really up my alley but my mum and disappointed start with our server absolutely delightful and they seemed very knowledgeable about menu my mum had duck breast and enjoyed flavour but not how there sort tendon running through each piece meat and difficult eat also found brussels sprout been charred little too far went potato crusted chicken which plated beautifully although really tasted like semi glorified tater tot but sadly underseasoned surprised breast meat used because not offer too much flavour which added further it blandness place served pig trotter daily special not expect fable use very boring part chicken ended up taking most my meal home and next day added sea salt and dijon mustard which added little more flavour being said when friend took birthday over year ago we had pretty decent lunch although you can t really go wrong with grilled cheese sandwich and salad would love come again and try something else hopefully we just had off night
Fable,it s really hard fable justice with star rating and review everyone most part called simply amazing and they re right food service atmosphere it s amazing i m going try my best bear with tldr too long not read version fable treat their customer like family you go more than once they remember you not just front staff but kitchen well not know what order ask your server second time fable our server guided u through menu completion awesome suggestion and you could tell loved her job food tasty you can t go wrong seriously warrant repeating service phenomenal first time ventured fable with group friend and family their chef tasting menu which bar overseeing kitchen what experience you got interact with staff see them sweat not food swear and just watch well oiled machine work it s magic we taken through menu what can only described culinary adventure food first recommended we start with oyster paired with bowmore assured would life changing and from then dinner only got better i ll spare you detail individual dish there are ton review will them better justice than can except one review said salty must insane roast beet salad delicious way start meal chickpea fritter just order them and thank later canned tuna hype life up but truthfully my stomach chooses fritter over tuna rabbit pot pie day s special need staple fable and i m tempted move my review star just make clear how serious am absolutely pleasure watching them make pot pie from scratch though well done everyone mascarpone cheesecake my favorite light and delicious way end meal parfait heavy hitter rich creamy delicious wine we opted sommelier pair our dish with oz pour and oyster bowmore pairing best decision we made wine explained u in friendly and what can only described exciting manner we actually eager try wine and discus note amongst ourselves yea u are wine nerd however it s in detail our sommelier explained pairing twice u either end table way no one missed out and everyone included service can t stress enough fable best service in town it s relaxed happy and friendly and they care really just come they really care your meal go perfectly i ll back no doubt about

Fable,amazing meal had yam and sage agnolotti with toasted almond broccolini and goat cheese not remember name dish menu told new item and first ever dessert had white chocolate mousse and rhubarb topped with crumbled toasted corn flake again wasn t exact name dish something like rhubarb cream such lovely taste and interesting texture friendly staff quick service reasonable price great atmosphere our server knew wine list well and able explain what various choice like get reservation crowded and we lucky gotten seat pm walking in off street next time i ll reserve table my only suggestion their menu look more like they belong in hamburger joint with color and font they chose they could with redesign look bit more elegant match presentation their food and slightly thicker stock paper not look raggedy after having been handed out couple time my first time there i ll definitely back again
Fable,good service and delicious food dish are good but nothing wow about would say enjoy octopus salad appetizer and spaghetti and meatball appetizer appetizer are better than entree think pulled pork gnocchi alright but too heavy would been better appetizer charging bread and butter big no no in my book bit turn off
Fable,my first try fable pretty mediocre and in my previous review said wouldn t going back but love brunch and end up heading over fable try out say noise issue much improved still had busy vibe but noise wasn t anywhere near crazy last time great we not reservation but seated pretty fast maybe minute wait them get table cleaned up perfect service good and fast my brunch amazing french toast mascarpone cream fruit preserve i m dying go back and again my brunch buddy had steak and egg but my meal clearly winner steak good but with black pepper jam taste pretty much like steak they serve dinner still good though
Fable,great place great menu great service duck moist and well flavored red cabbage smart accompaniment croquette perfect ratio confit potato make your flatbread concept fun interesting canned tuna unusual and tasty cured lemon nice touch come with toast bite white cheddar cornbread with chipotle butter delicious pork chop generous serving chicken good but not outstanding

Fable,visited place last week during lunch nice weather but completely swamped with people lunch took more than hour which downside otherwise food decent wanted order burger but sold out big disappointment hence ordered vegetarian pasta with chorizo added tasted like cream pesto pasta which good but nothing crazy liked overall ambience but service relatively slow my brother had egg benedict which average will return again but hope they would stock enough burger next time
Fable,food tasted amazingly fresh had egg benedict with ham along with pulled pork johnny cake hollandaise sauce not overpowering with lemon juice which pulled in subtle flavor delicious ham usually not like savory and sweet dish but johnny cake exception loved pulled pork and jalape o stuffed in pancake and flavorful not even need add maple syrup service exceptional and waitress there patient with our big group would definitely come back

Fable,got opportunity dine fable recent trip vancouver with two my friend can t say enough about restaurant trevor and curtis had their game night being little budget conscious grad school student we had try and make most our splurge meal without having take out loan finance food wise highlight meal proclaimed best canned tuna my friend and not even order initially but trevor insisted u trying and actually comped u had lot live up with name like and exceeded my expectation tuna jarred with potato lemon tomato and olive oil and slowed cook over time once you open jar crush and mix content you re in delightful experience there s sense intense richness with refreshing hint lemon my friend agreed when topped over toasted bread reminded u sort savory lemon bar food definitely worth trip in and however highlight night sitting counter facing kitchen there where we got see trevor and company what they best trevor curtis and whole staff personable and interactive throughout whole meal food just part dining experience important one course but atmosphere and interaction with staff also important by end night almost we had been friend with trevor et al long time we treated well in nutshell i d highly recommend fable sure get spot kitchen counter and hopefully you re experience will memorable ours
Fable,beyond yum quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in vancouver bc fresh and delightful food option get more delicious course by course enjoyed mussel with chorizo with broth good you will want drink you can keep classy and dip grilled bread accompanying instead chicken wing are perfectly crisp and sauced corn gnocchi with pesto and pulled pork epic delight drink are beautiful they are tasty and unique always experience great attentive service definitley make reservation course food fantastic in demand get list and you won t sorry fable magnificent adventure tastebud
Fable,we went there my birthday dinner and everything fabulous starting with appetizer canned tuna it s nothing like canned tuna made with albacore tuna and layered with potato and lemon good liver quite good too but won t my favourite meatball my friend had and yummy his only complaint wished could more main duck love duck breast and cooked perfect pickled beet side perfect side flat iron steak my hubby had and said good and loved side came with can t remember what they but apparently very delicious now highlight meal mean everything fabulous but their dessert out world good could licked whole bowl in privacy my house lemon pot de cream lemony custard with gin foam and grenada holy crap good not too sweet and too lemony just right amount sweetness needed after big meal opera torte my sister had and wasn t too sweet and not make feel like eating cup sugar and espresso ice cream and chocolate like match made in heaven cocktail had kiss from rose gin with rose syrup learn how make because too damn good dinner fantastic and we happy end meal
Fable,popped in lunch anyone can make nice burger tasty pasta real test restaurant lie in it creativity and standard ordered chick pea fritter and ling cod weird check pea friiter over roasted covered by thick layer mayo dressing ling cod few tasty piece cod sitting salad also covered by thick layer dressing my impression kitchen crew are young and experimental featuring sharp favour but not always combining favour in harmonious blend remarked there too much salad dressing food manager apologized and offered free dessert plus them would recommend diner should stick conventional food in restaurant
Fable,thank you michael l we stopped and went no further lol epic mind blowing dinner we ever had steak fritte and gnocchi with pork belly main and chickpea fritter appie food good took over our conversation entire evening not let sticker shock caesar fool you would almost classify appetizer candied pork belly stick with unique gazpacho base staff remarkable peaceful os make you think there may something yoga organic non gmo lifestyle wish had room order more item from their menu maybe next time
Fable,best restaurant i ve ever been too period and yes i ve been hawksworth wildebeest and like something compare brunch lunch dinner just drink end long day there no better place in city flavor explode off each dish served are just insane and right inline with wicked staff their ability paint visual picture everything new chef creates awesome recommend you start with oak coke and canned tuna and let flow from there can t pick just one main menu freshened up often dependent fresh ingredient course are sourced locally but can guarantee you can t go wrong
Fable,another place where owner chef care about food serf starting growing food roof establishment seasonal food done right love
Fable,home my favourite dish in whole world duck meatball with tagliatelle once when eating coat rack accidentally fell and got free dessert nice too chose lemon meringue parfait earl grey ice cream subtle and delicious
Fable,good atmosphere spaghetti and meatball appy good one time we ordered over salted though not fan canned tuna not sure it s popular there but hey everyones personal preference are different food fresh and unique
Fable,my brother tendency going fancy place when we go visit place it s tad annoying however my brother s best friend vancouver local suggested fable u our last brunch in vancouver definitely packed in there when we went we waited about minute and we seated right away which pretty surprising myself got scrambled egg fable brioche rosti o m g one best scrambled egg ever had in my life kid you not super impressed by place what can you say hipster know how their brunch will definitely come back when go back vancouver
Fable,went fable boozy brunch last sunday every month with my girlfriend they had been before and raved about needle say had pretty high expectation good booze indeed boozy and very very reasonable okay french toast ate but wasn t anything special too soft in middle bad we rushed out before hour even though our seating hour and half took forever drink make u they out ketchup because direct quote someone forgot make morning my girlfriend benny undercooked and not get compensation new plate my four dollar bacon side one piece bacon good but clarify somewhere my friend even said they appalled by service and they had never had experience like prior maybe bad day fable but won t returning based experience
Fable,we had friend coming in from out town and thought would great opportunity try out restaurant we ve heard much about hype true we enjoyed beautifully prepared dish in room reflects vancouver well great atmosphere crowd noise but not overwhelming you get feeling being in well liked comfortable place and can still carry conversation with table friend our server very friendly and professional when we asked recommendation proceeded explain each item in more detail and helped u make excellent choice portion quite generous and certainly filling lot great flavour had onion gnocchi with pulled pork and certainly would again sampled canned tuna which also excellent our friend from san fran loved vibe room friendly wait staff and overall experience we will definitely return highly recommended
Fable,not know what they put in their food but it s addictive often aggressive craving fable needle say food amazing service alway great too but space bit too jammed my liking though like said food make up my favourite item menu are spaghetti and meatball beef burger house green salad wild salmon
Fable,came with my husband his birthday we had always heard great review about fable looking forward trying time keeping relatively neutral expectation made reservation couple day in advance pm we seated right away small table in middle dining area we starving we ordered chickpea fritter and canned tuna two appetizer think we preferred chickpea fritter tuna definitely unlike anything i ve eaten anywhere else and interesting but not know out world lot reviewer made out although enjoyed light lemony flavor and unique texture potato and tuna just wasn t blown away still worth trying least once though entree ordered onion gnocchi with pulled pork and husband ordered flat iron steak with veggie flavor dish great pulled pork amazingly soft and tender and gnocchi large in size but soft and pillowy not heavy like one might expect from carby italian inspired dish husband had not tried flat iron steak before and not know what expect but flavorful not too tough and cooked perfectly medium rare service good our server friendly and various staff apologized when our entree came late they went extra step by comping our dessert s more brownie which really nice thing overall good experience fable one comment would it s not largest restaurant and get very loud when full capacity not fault restaurant course but it s something worth mentioning in case you re considering place quiet romantic date would definitely come back try out their brunch
Fable,my boyfriend and wanted check place out awhile but seems always slammed we started with chickpea fritter tonight presentation point but overkill salt our main entree we ordered steelhead trout and duck breast i m big fish eater but when took my first bite trout really fishy asked our server suppose made raw took back and made medium when came back better but still fishy kale salad came with trout drenched in super salty vinegary dressing duck breast with quinoa good overall dish hope just off day kitchen cause we quite disappointed
Fable,amazing try their gnocchi favorable very cute restaurant everything made fresh and very good customer service even owner might great you your table often
Fable,first impression are key and hostess start you off winning note time i ve been there wait hostess took my name and number and offered call when table ready with prime location west th my dining companion and had ample time walk around and window shopping waiting our table when table ready hostess fired off quick text and call let know place always packed but not feel loud overly crowded service friendly and attentive price are fair and quality excellent cocktail are delicious canned tuna fantastic chickpea fritter are great lemon meringue parfait really freaking good trust jody b s review menu item in term main meal my selection very tasty time but not blow my mind first time went dinner really wanted squash gnocchi but ordered steelhead trout instead because my dining companion ordered my first choice dish took one team add bit variety but wished had gotten gnocchi after my meal excellent no complaint but no gnocchi my second visit brunch and ordered fable egg dish savory flavor fan tomato jam s sweetness touch heavy but still finished every bite my dining companion and not however finish rosti side dish which little dry my one complaint would really really wish they had canned tuna available during brunch service complaint though overall am big fan place but it s not quite star one final impression hostess remembered my name thanks u coming upon our exit nicely done and perfect little touch mean lot and tell kind place want come back again and again
Fable,best ever eating experience in town delicious and fine food corner not too much pricy staff good and cooperative may in my next visit fable can earn star from
Fable,we in town three day and went many restaurant possible we had eat pm get into fable clearly they are very popular we enjoyed chambar immensely and highly recommend first choice in town we started with cornbread probably best cornbread ever had really special and recommend my spouse had special beef which prepared in sou vide piece meat extremely fatty expected imagine with cut point half serving inedible not sure how work around just bit disappointing pepper jelly they served with had bit soy kick and just really not make sense with everything else plate component good in total dish just not work had onion gnocchi with pulled pork again component passable but confusing dish gnocchi good it but pesto salty alone fine but needed something in plate calm pulled port actually really good pulled pork but made absolutely no sense with dish ended up feeling like had gone through buffet line really good buffet line given and picked up random item drink decent we ended up not getting dessert because frustrated with food service excellent and vibe in restaurant great almost never send thing back in restaurant really feel especially high end place like want your first and best effort and in case wasn t skill issue dish creation issue compare chambar felt like dish there inspired everything plate made much sense together found myself carefully constructing bite make sure not missing out anything end day think clearly one better place eat in town just really think work need done with critical eye flavor and texture combination chef skilled and experience positive end day food what matter most next time we are in vancouver we probably would give another shot

Fable,dissapointed with fable maybe because heard many good thing about and had high expectation we went there brunch remembrance day long weekend wait about half hour cool ambiance nice decor but we weren t happy with service first server not familiar with menu not know what menu ingredient not even know steak and egg come with two egg one egg had go back kitchen and ask our question finally ended up sending one guy from kitchen our table answer our question starting with coffee we ordered americano and regular coffee i m not sure americano really americano coffee wasn t hot enough we ordered fable egg and scrambled egg food ok nothing special too tasty scramble and spinach and lardons served in mason jar which made hard eat like when restaurant try creative and unique but think it s important practical time mason jar idea reminded story fox and stork http www story net in fox and stork moral story html m we also ordered side rosti and asked server chive cream side instead top rosti dietary reason but came with creme top anyway food mediocre nothing really special think fable one those restaurant base their reputation farm table philosophy rather than focusing taste food and quality service said would go back there dinner before making my final judgement

Fable,congratulation trevor bird and friend fable really lived up hype u nice see whole team working together and really putting their money where their mouth service top notch can say about star off because our version famed canned tuna extremely fishy like kinda grossed u out and yes we are sashimi people i m sure we just got bad batch also my steelhead really undercooked like lighter cooked side but bordering raw which wasn t appropriate particular dish perhaps my taste bud bit sensitive after fishy fishy tuna everything else chickpea fritter duck libation superb our table sucked first table directly in line with front door and freeeeezing whole dinner from draft pulling through but that s vancouver dining you guess ordered boozy hot apple cider yum counteract chill helped but would helped even more house since pretty obvious suffering thanks yelp letting reach my cheeky quota day anyways go fable just keep in mind vibe bistro not fine dining value driven menu thoughtfully reflects fact and you will happy
Fable,wow really extraordinary food and off chart wine list knew they had verdejo albari o grape wine in bc they are genuinely nice also our first impression wasn t correct and i m happy say
Fable,my lovely friend took out fable my birthday we told we could not make reservation we went pm get first come first served table actually we seated quite quickly that s good food very interestingly good especially canned tuna taretare chick pea frits slightly dry but still liked and trout juicy with my favourite kale side would been star but we asked move another table near end our meal really disrupted u server should told u from beginning our table only available pm least we knew awkward having get up move everything another table and get seated again most awkward part we got another server had no idea what s happening and offered u water again with menu we asked bill instead because we pretty much done eating by then awkward feel sorry second server not get tip but try give u good service and had clear our table after we left oh well
Fable,had brunch benedict with olive oil hollandaise with ham want try smoked salmon one next time would better in my opinion but still very nice scrambled egg fable brioche potato loved but others not excited with dish steak and egg potato rustic bread steak yes egg yes what can go wrong with steak and egg pulled pork johnny cake not my favourite but still pretty interesting idea pulled pork with pancake

Fable,great service nice food and unique flavour like corn bread and pulled pork gnocchi compare with flying pig in town food more fun and interesting
Fable,restaurant should lesson restauranteurs out there service amazing their commitment quality food unbelievable when one our apps went back only half eaten they took notice and without u even asking they offered comp due being undercooked i ve been restaurant before where you aren t satisfied with your meal they ll comp but never been restaurant where they keep eye how much food left plate outstanding chef and staff really want you best dining experience they can offer and they deliver only reason i m not giving star drink tasty are weak and pricey said weakness their dessert also leave bit improved upon we ordered three and they either too sweet not sweet enough addition dessert specialist their staff may in order quick breakdown our meal halibut incredible short rib special outstanding duck liver pate app delicious drink tasty but light dessert sweet and not sweet in summary their chef know how cook kick as meal their staff should teaching everyone in vancouver how run restaurant and you go fable you will one best dining experience are offered in vancouver i d put them up next forage and bishop that s how good they are
Fable,food everyone greatly enjoyed their meal thought few dish could had bit more punch them but beautifully arranged and fairly priced service service prompt and always there when needed but not overbearing however certainly not love skate shoe flannel and jean our server wearing not usually care attire but when you dress like you re rolling out bed go show lack care respect your clientele absolutely no different then how you plate food you wouldn t expect them slop food plate should service staff get away with looking like room very very cramped hot space know that s what most vancouver these day but not like being treated like i m being shoved into room with many body they can possibly fit
Fable,one my favourite place eat in vancouver food ambience are great service variable sometimes excellent sometimes little bit aloof but always polite make sure you book in advance evening dinner and prepared line up weekend brunch we enjoyed spaghetti meatball well should meatball singular it s one tasty moist duck meatball roast chicken duck breast and mussles there are sometime great find daily special board like roast pork share family style dessert are ok taste good but nothing special sitting bar next kitchen can quite fun watching chef prepare food during busy service they changed up menu more frequently i d eat even more often highly recommended

Fable,great weekend brunch and dinner service excellent and staff friendly and attentive
Fable,fable kind suffers problem portion size and flavor complexity canned tuna canned tuna something they pitch where come in mason jar it s good gnocchi gnocchi pretty fresh but meal find hard recommend stand alone just seems kind odd eat just eat potato type dumpling meal potato crusted chicken good dish overall just kind think fable not give enough food their portion you are going small portion like fancy food they up your flavor complexity with more layer and depth food okay and good but not great and not bad just ok yelp say suppose
Fable,came with five friend long weekend getaway vacation research and fable sounded good well i m happy say exceeded expectation food outstanding starting with bread not simply couple roll placed table but rather awesome freshly baked sourdough bread from there everything continued delight especially gnocchi also national caesar day and fable s are sooo good service exceptional too and atmosphere great bottom line i m ever back in vancouver i m coming back restaurant
Fable,fable stand farm table and their name truly reflective their value first encountered fable in google search when looking way commit eating ethically sourced meat contacted fable ask them where they purchased their product from and blown away by amount information they provided with these guy are truly commited buying most ethical meat response recieved from their awesome team we are restaurant you exactly what we are about we get much our meat from two river since they are very transparent about source their animal and we know farm they source from treat their animal well and welcomed u inspect their facility most our pig we get from walter and we know them their name we still keep our first pig s skull top our preserve cabinet ralph sorry too morbid am glad you asked where we get our meat and produce from heart our farm table concept our veggie and green are also local trevor instramental in helping local garden get going allows u keep local and natural beyond ethical component food exceptional and they are always offering uo great daily special service always been great and room includes very cool decor love fable
Fable,saw place yelp and thought yes fresh local ingredient i m sucker sort thing well dish are pricey and seems main seasoning they use sea salt although they replaced my dish only after much coaxing and detailed in depth explanation their pumpkin risotto bland too creamy too salty and what make you think pesto go with not sir no sir not waitress genial which nice but overall menu option limited overpriced and cooking done by amateur looked like they hired kitchen staff from ubc s pit pub something no probably won t back
Fable,good not great canned tuna good but not spectacular chickpea fritter dry but had delicious sauce and pickled red onion lentil ragout worst out three lentil dish i ve had lately note two amazing best part meal salted almond chocolate bark came with our dessert
Fable,brunch year ago and good but not blow my mind came back dinner time around and loved my partner bunch food sensitivity and staff really awesome about we got two starter chickpea fritter sorta falafel topped with pickled onion watercress and curry mayo and best canned tuna albacore poached in olive oil cherry tomato potato lemon rind they pretty tasty we also split special which peace river lamb rack and house made merguez bed spaetzle mixed in with finely chopped kale and drizzled with rich tasty sauce speckled with mustard seed they actually served spaetzle side accommodate my partner s food sensitivity lamb cooked perfectly medium rare although could used tiny touch more salt merguez tasty and spaetzle like chowing million tiny fluffy pancake delightful personally think place chambar beat hand
Fable,vacation with my family party but only went dinner from san diego and found place yelp we needed place would accommodate large party last minute from moment made call over phone time we left service great and definitely place would come back regularly we from food not disappoint think we ordered more than half menu and great would post picture but we ate before we could even think take pic and since they knew we from out town they gave u recommendation great food stop hand best experience overall
Fable,place even better than advertised flavor well thought out and paired together perfectly with subtle unique twist really get you thinking about ingredient well conceived dish expertly carried out and service amazing entire staff helpful intelligent and friendly place vancouver must
Fable,okay like everyone else i ve heard hype about fable believe sister restaurant campagnolo and like place showed up friday night with no reservation not expect get seated night but thought least there could slim possibility my party two could wait bar table nothing doing restaurant full bar also full okay popular good them now here s irritating part ditsy hostess actually suggested with straight face we stand entrance minute estimated would take get seat bar even though next table wouldn t available there s one thing irritates it s when restaurant get opinion themselves in cloud and they are doing mankind huge favour by simply being open well vancouver there are hundred spectacular place eat and fable will not one them and high opinion they themselves now may borrowed time because restaurant not sustain level success not hope their failure but they re kind setting themselves up hard landing had issue with chambar few year ago and not been back since chambar doing fine hear and that s great them but can t bothered with these hoity toity attitude spoil my appetite hence star

Fable,another place feel like i m being hard fable because there much great but place like should quality cocktail least decent one based earlier review describing problem fable just hasn t bothered make wonder about quality their wine list good and great special appetizer cheese cornbread very good wasn t super rich and wasn t dry cheese wasn t overwhelming and jalapeno whipped butter worked well with chickpea fritter are incredible combination fritter with house made mayonnaise and pea shoot think with pickled onion wow trout also amazing just made open faced sandwich with leftover and still amazing worth price except may ruined lesser fish dish my husband enjoyed lentil ragout lot though thought too salty service consistently very good bad cocktail very disappointing we ordered two off menu old fashioned made with victoria gin s aged gin and forget name but ingredient started with wiser s deluxe whiskey and ended with giffard s pomegranate we also had manhattan they bad and them seemed uninformed old fashioned drink are whiskey drink knew ordering one with aged gin would experimental might not my favorite and would okay would been except looked like take old fashioned served before people remembered it s supposed simple drink had orange slice and maraschino cherry and very sweet wiser s drink wiser s deluxe okay canadian whiskey still drink sounded interesting menu started promisingly with grapefruit garnish nicely done but drinking like drinking pomegranate syrup no balance barely sense whiskey ingredient and course small not complain when dislike something matter personal preference only rare occasion when it s clear something went drastically wrong corked wine taste like someone spilled salt my dish etc but bad when waitress asked how cocktail we actually said something great and offered take off bill and replace with something else my husband asked manhattan generally safe drink like worst manhattan either u tasted in long time and time i m including what got from open bar recent conference reception vancouver great bar and it fine restaurant tend take their cocktail seriously maybe they serve mostly wine and beer and specialized cocktail offering with small selection bottle and specific drink maybe they find someone really know world cocktail run their bar either way they use quality ingredient know what classic drink should look and taste like and work make sure their house cocktail are good and maybe even interesting seems fable need take advantage resource town there are interesting bottle behind it bar but wonder there s anyone would know what with them and there even basic drink darn bad

Fable,saw georgia straight golden plate review and decided would check fable out not disappointed in slightest lunch my mother and ordered chickpea fritter and golden beat salad impeccably dressed and would go back just fritter my mother had shepherd pie which felt slightly lackluster and had vegetarian tagliatelle with chorizo and beyond happy with my choice great portion size and very balanced set flavour service great not out world but last minute lunch decision would definitely go back
Fable,honestly never seen top chef canada but resturant recommended by friend figured would give try not disappoint they resturant cozy warm and very inviting called ahead make reservation but told reservation table full but they save walk in table and they more than able accommodate u wait staff super friendly knowledgeable and efficient cool how you can see and mostly smell everything going inside kitchen had started with oyster never had one thought no time like present one really tasty granted nothing compare would another oyster saying anything although there not much menu vegetarian like my husband had steak which very flavorful with black pepper jelly my husband had gnocchi which said bit over cooked and very small in portion size definatley left hungry and could honestly had bit more too but food really delicious and worth visit
Fable,we had tried twice visit fable without luck made reservation well in advance my daughter s birthday course my expectation are raised food good but not stellar but good value kitsilano service extremely casual and seemed very inexperienced but we not major complaint but what really got that ll with such limited menu every main course and few starter had button mushroom seemed bit too much but perhaps only because not care mushroom wine list seemed pretty ordinary and expensive
Fable,food fabulous service hit and miss and there hint elitism different sense pride about staff i ve been couple time last time waitress friendly attentive and bubbly even with full restaurant time waitress different one surley definitely not attentive and boarderline rude giving off attitude we last people wanted serve menu good variety and my friend and thoroughly enjoyed our meal personally would recommend pulled pork benedict food and drink come out surprisingly quickly given demand place had not been shitty waitress certainly not deserve tip review would been bit better
Fable,fable very good but it s missing little thing move restaurant from good amazing good canned tuna fun and in general fish dish i ve had there are solid my favorite appetizer duck meatball dessert are truly fabulous and well worth saving room they best part everyone s meal service also very good server gave good recommendation very friendly and meal well timed disappointing cocktail are disappointing they re what you might order patio summer day without food but aren t kind drink go well with nice dinner also not big fan reservation system

Jam Cafe on Beatty,place pretty popular with local thought might full tourist like u but nope everyone seemed live in area that s mighty power eavesdropping right there anyway we stood in line about hour and by we mean my wife and daughter took my daughter asian grocery store around way about min by wife tell come back now good because starving we quickly order up brioche french toast blueberry lemon triple stack pancake huevos rancheros and mac and cheese because french toast made with brioche just made much better but when it s topped with caramlized cinnamon apple you really can t much better well maybe little whipped cream might cut sweetness little pancake really good they many different topping choose from my daughter went with blueberry lemon devoured maybe not pancake but most hey come she s huevos rancheros ok but living most my early life in san diego you get spoiled with mexican food great visit we left happy and our stomach full deliciousness definitely restaurant worth long wait
Jam Cafe on Beatty,two visit far we waited one hour in cold most recent visit but time oh my word brunch been incredible style serving their dish commendable feel like always walk into place and can see appreciation culinary perfection they make their jam which mouthwatering delicious during my visit far i ve tried chicken and french toast macaroni and cheese and later tater bowl with chipotle chicken macaroni and cheese side little heavy but good definitely not kraft macaroni and cheese although still enjoy but anyone want comparison french toast day memorable perfect blend maple and bbq sauce and having sweet and savory balance never thought i d eat fried chicken with toast breakfast but wow it s worthwhile later tater bowl smoky flavor and with avocado added even more epic really enjoy eating tater tot dish reasonable choice someone cannot bear eat tater tot many them wouldn t recommend dish because very tater ful definitely recommend place hand best brunch i ve had in vancouver
Jam Cafe on Beatty,favourite pancake must side mac and cheese only way not line up hour go weekday
Jam Cafe on Beatty,maybe we just ordered wrong thing but extremely underwhelmed by food space charming rustic and staff nice and friendly but food found disappointing such popular brunch place had charlie bowl which biscuit and shredded potato difficult distinguish two and ham and bacon bacon pretty good there just little there honestly not seem much else bowl tasted bland ate maybe portion huge took rest home because not want waste food but i m going make thing eat with co it s not something i d want just dig in with spoon my friend got later tater bowl which better had crispiest tater tot i d ever had but pulled pork just sweet without much depth we also shared dutch baby special day strawberry shortcake which they neglected tell u not regular one are just okay i d never had one before and wouldn t get again dense and soggy can imagine coming back and trying thing maybe french toast but it s real effort avoid long line we came minute before they opened sunday and got last available seat during first round seating especially after today s experience it s not something would wait hour
Jam Cafe on Beatty,omfg place life up hype am still dreaming cinnamon swirl pancake and talking about them these best pancake ever eaten and make gourmet pancake weekly my son told our server are better hahaha but wrong these are amazing flavor profile over top delicious with layer sweet goodness could again would skip savory meal and order different layer pancake cinnamon swirl not flavor would chosen would chosen red velvet blueberry lemon even chocolate chocolate chip but now cannot imagine pancake tasting better than these worth wait and wish we would eaten earlier our trip we could try pancake flavor note table next u looked like they ordered savory pancake with pulled pork and pickled onion top
Jam Cafe on Beatty,best breatfast ever worth waiting minute table

Jam Cafe on Beatty,okay like others heard many great thing about restaurant and how there are long lineup get in well finally got chance go first time and nothing special been better place in vancouver serve great breakfast and brunch food had their smoked salmon benny and okay shredded hash brown tasted like potato not clean prior shredding and had no flavour one positive thing with benny hollandaise sauce also ordered their famous cinnamon bun pancake and dry only thing helped adding more syrup give more moisture too much hype and not worth lining up
Jam Cafe on Beatty,been hunt my favourite brunch place and last think found with jam cafe apart from ridiculous hour long wait time get in good indication pure genius their menu place actually good kid kid menu perfect great variety and portion size they had booster seat and really helpful when you re party with toddler best chicken and waffle i ve had ever fried chicken well seasoned and crispy without being greasy waffle and fluffy and melt in your mouth and gravy icing cake great variety brunch menu we overwhelmed with choice and in my view that s always good problem highly recommend chicken and waffle cinnamon bun pancake and fried chicken egg benedict taste upon taste upon taste generous size portion and very reasonable price most average around per plate will making my go place brunch going forward
Jam Cafe on Beatty,biscuit basic and they only gave enough gravy half gravy decent but had no edge something make standout from other s had scrape in egg yolk there kind flavoring nd half biscuit bacon ok hash brown pretty good hollandaise sauce benedict just ok my over easy egg cooked perfectly though service great with girl even walking outside offering umbrella people waiting in rain
Jam Cafe on Beatty,finally got check out one most popular brunch place in vancouver my boyfriend and arrived brunch place minute after opened up like around am and there already small line out door stood in line maybe minute and by then line crazy long upon getting seated we told our waiter we had leave soon because we needed catch our flight and waiter accommodating they ensured food would come out faster and even when we ended up taking food go wrapped in nice box u and included utensil when we not ask service amazing now onto food pancake delish add maple syrup since canadian maple syrup best pancake really fluffy charlie bowl essentially reminds type breakfast mixed together into bowl since contains biscuit meat egg etc quite delicious but and my boyfriend could not finish either these plate and we shared portion are huge we had lot take home but made nice dinner
Jam Cafe on Beatty,mean it s good food unique and trendy but not worth waiting greater than minute there long as lineup and wait it s actually going hour more and by time you get in you risk being very hangry beware alright now said my hubby and went my birthday and got festive mimosa drink s and lavender creative and tasty ordered pork belly benny and wasn t awed by but wanted try their signature dish since you normally see bacon and salmon served most restaurant i d rather go cafe yen better yet botanist solid egg benedict hubby got prime meal make visit worthwhile later tater bowl despite being ravenous when we seated they least pretty speedy in kitchen and we went our way carrying home leftover
Jam Cafe on Beatty,when you see place open am and already person lineup you know it s overhyped and yes jam overhyped will not revolutionize your life not enough worth absurd lineup form you arrive time after opening but it s damn solid menu can tell you much i ve often avoided brunch because menu tend look bunch variation egg benny sandwich one three variation each skillet pancake and maybe waffle jam still fall into high carb north american cuisine but most dish are very least twist usual incorporating thing like southern biscuit naan tater tot and deep fried sausage tried tater bowl and personally found good overall tater crunchy and plentiful and cheese nice touch though bit sparse pulled pork fine but say i ve had more flavourful pulled pork several place very plain and portion are absolutely bonkers realistically tater bowl charlie bowl could handily feed two people you re not blown away you ll stuck with lot just okay leftover also tried dutch baby excited because it s similar traditional dish in my family something we call bismarck large crispy cr pe pancake filled with buttery sweet unfortunately dutch baby definitely not crisp it s puffy and fairly soggy and really just okay i m torn how rate jam want give star creative menu but want give star food being just fine and hype and wait being very off putting think i ll stick with now because ended up feeling like i d waited lot okay good food and felt like would preferred pay le half portion size rather than get much something wasn t super impressive but want go back because maybe menu item will click with better that s draw creative menu guess
Jam Cafe on Beatty,gravy coop chicken sausa decent biscuit gravy chicken meal chicken pretty dry but breading done well and tasty gravy more creamy with le meaty taste than like brioche french toast w carmelized apple delicious gobbled right up bread soft and soaked with just right amount syrup coupled with slight tangy sweetness from carmelized apple would come again just alone pamplemousse mimosa very mediocre wasn t t very strong and bitterness from grapefruit skin overrode sweet grapefruit juice hoping
Jam Cafe on Beatty,what s your brunch plan christas day jamcafeyvr always good place you not mind spending hour wait in line went jam cafe rainy weekday brunch and lucky enough there only half hour line up been couple time but my first time order their chicken waffle and three pig chicken waffle good personally liked more than their chicken toast three pig pretty special too it s liked pancake wrapped around sausage
Jam Cafe on Beatty,definitely one my top restaurant in vancouver and one worth hype yes you wait in insanely long line just get seated but food make up and more price are reasonable and portion are massive come hungry veggie bowl guy i m still fantasising about veggie bowl yes literally just massive bowl carbs but care hash brown could little crispier and there could more vegetable my health but overall delectable dish egg corn salsa biscuit and hash brown added complexity flavour and texture bowl will get again lonely piggy not try because not like sausage but everyone else said pretty good just little heavy side because kind oily corned beef hash skillet my brother had and wasn t really biggest fan but said alright chicken n waffle my parent shared and they said pretty decent chicken not too dry and nicely fried and waffle alright well we could not finish everything because portion are literally gigantic but you massive appetite like only one finished everything come and get veggie bowl because it s probably best thing menu will back
Jam Cafe on Beatty,my favourite spot brunch in city my go later tater bowl pork belly egg benedict and always with jam iced coffee probably visited half dozen time and always am happy with service food and atmosphere only downside you get there past am there good chance you will waiting in long line get there early wait till just before they close highly recommend checking place out delicious brunch option
Jam Cafe on Beatty,jam cafe one most popular brunch and foodie spot vancouver touristy spot expect long line they open am line probably begin am line am out door least hour long ordered go not wait inside pretty small and tight seating pretty limited maybe max party food not take long ready after called le then minute limited street parking main street always packed jam you might park way around corner paid meter old town breakfast great basic breakfast plate egg cooked perfectly light and fluffy bacon thick and salty good crisp hash brown crispy fried chicken benedict perfectly poached egg chicken nicely fried liked little seasoning egg corn nice texture change hollandaise creamy and rich come with hash brown and fruit red velvet pancake popular but thought just ok large pancake thick but more dense then fluffy strong cocoa flavor cream cheese sauce sweet gave red velvet cupcake feel

Jam Cafe on Beatty,with hype been constantly going around about jam cafe we decided build up courage and try out friday morning we got there around am and waited bit over hour cold and drizzling but we knew we had endure we felt lucky because we weren t even last people in line menu very extensive and think that s what caught my eye because there many option and had heard portion are huge am not very picky eater hard decide what eat knew should try something different and popular my mom had feature early grey french toast i m not usually fan but delicious had tater tot bowl and not disappointed and knew would good anyways because not love tater tot my only small complaint would price side egg said even though wanted one that s insane and love food but not think could wait long in line unless they implemented testing could walk around downtown and know when should come back

Jam Cafe on Beatty,try not judge business based expectation because could unfair place with good reputation but cafe with hour long wait and retractable belt barrier around queue damn could not help but constantly question thing living up hype breakdown classic mimosa w grapefruit juice refreshing and tasty fried chicken benedict crazy about roasted corn salsa awesome touch timeless dish however egg not poached and hashbrown bland and hard brioche french toast w caramelized apple and cinnamon nice sweet treat glad we shared one because probably would ve been too much one person handle farmer s breakfast skillet very ordinary and pretty disappointed by size we opted cranberry toast which thought star show service bit detached and surprisingly slow make think line outside result slow turnover rate and not necessarily food s goodness gotta hand host and waiter dealing with such large volume customer though not mention kitchen which must going bonkers said something about workflow got reevaluated verdict it s good but underwhelming you arrive early are brunch fiend then say go but not die
Jam Cafe on Beatty,read review before coming and decided make my judgement yes wait long and let tell you isn t worth we only waited in line about min compared certain people hour wait but anyways food sub par barely flavor just not good took few bite our order food refunded from manager after pretty much saying my girlfriend kept eating wouldn t refund u literally took nibble toast after asked left disappointed super small place too elbow elbow with people you not know you feel like waiting really long alright food and sit in crammed place you food even decent they could make up everything else but sadly not
Jam Cafe on Beatty,good but over hyped could give would we arrived just before opening but unfortunately missed cut and had wait min which fine and most great place require wait time unfortunate they no phone buzzer system like most place are used longer wait time we had banana walnut pancake granola parfait and coffee bean from drum roaster cobble hill bc coffee actually little bitter and acidic not great but refill plentiful way barista prepares even filter drip coffee huge effect profile coffee not necessarily reflection roaster food good balance granola and yoghurt with fruit quite tasty but granola could more flavourful and varied pancake portion huge banana tasty they glazed but bit too soggy my liking pancake themselves quite good but rather plain and stodgy honest emma s country kitchen in toronto still my favourite cinnamon and whole wheat flour would make much better would mixing in ingredient batter service good far attentiveness and pleasantness however absolutely felt rushed and pushed out turnover bill brought without asking question you need card machine without even having my wallet out indication ready pay know there queue outside but guarantee they are rushing not customer outside but turnover we just wait outside min not cool mid drinking my refill coffee asked advise go there no queue otherwise it s really not worth

Jam Cafe on Beatty,first off let say egg benedict not ever my dish choice breakfast my friend local recommended come and try reluctantly agreed ordered veggie benedict with hash brown and completely exceeded my expectation could probably eat dish everyday hash brown best i ve ever had well self professed potato addict care more about how my potato taste than my egg hash brown cooked perfection crispy outside and soft inside grilled tomato kind seemed like random addition initially but added hint acidic flavor which balanced out dish perfectly we also ordered stuffed nutella and banana french toast pretty good but little too rich my palette just wish they had location in la because find myself thinking about their veggie benedict time
Jam Cafe on Beatty,jam tried and true review ultimately fantastic spot party kid are definitely welcomed see picture proof adventurer decor will catch eye staff kind enough allow u grab coffee we wait not something they currently offer asked but maybe they are reading catch during winter we waited min in line not uncommon am saturday food inventive large portioned and flavorful no detail left out and it s well thought restaurant event washroom parking opportunity are not concern in review

Jam Cafe on Beatty,ok you know when you find great place yelp highly reviewed and can t wait review yourself but your friend dig into food before you can take picture what happened jam cafe sorry picture i m going give jam benefit doubt and just say we must not ordered well because we would definitely not go back not typical breakfast joint not expect normal flavor normal thing here s what we ordered london fog because when in canada you probably need chicken n waffle disappointing nothing seasoned made u sad pulled pork pancake super weird we not expecting flavor in one and disappointing there cabbage and oddly flavored sauce think asian korean food mashed with american very gummy pancake we left most table side bacon just not impressive we went with lot thing highly recommended and waitress recommended but just not our place wouldn t go back
Jam Cafe on Beatty,one rare instance where completely missed hype we came around weekday and walked away line too far street next day we returned around am third in line and waited about minute interior small but cozy and server very nice and helpful per our waitress s recommendation tried egg benedict with their famous fried chicken egg benedict and biscuit standard chicken however much too over fried and dry which bummer potato hash also just standard underwhelmed say least friend tried huevo ranchero which again dry which not even think possible corn bread dry though fair i m not biggest fan corn bread in first place rest plate pretty unremarkable perhaps we just missed mark and got wrong item i m not sure left feeling like wasted our time in city and calorie

Jam Cafe on Beatty,word jam cafe spot get brunch in vancouver and appears with line outside door every weekend first time spotted place when went next door chambar few year ago and wondered what line and since then never made jam cafe because long line always turned off but in my most recent trip vancouver my friend and decided finally make happen night before we looked up what time open am and made plan get there right opening despite how hungover we knew we d we walked from our hotel robson street which five minute walk and arrived right eight and guess what there already line though once we got in line and number four list we waited hour finally get inside apparently people wait in line even before jam cafe open one employee would walk outside every now and then and would get quantity each party and take coffee order we waited mentioned since there many people formed line before opened they filled every seat inside which even when you get opening there will wait good know when my friend and finally made inside we beyond gleeful we finally could sit everything menu looked good truly even though hour wait perfect time browse menu prior getting inside and deciding what we d want my friend and still needed minute finalize our decision ended up getting gravy coupe with side red velvet pancake despite how crazy busy place our server super friendly and patient and food came out quicker than expected food looked delicious and patron sitting table next u admitted after seeing our plate there may game changer there s nothing like fried chicken with biscuit slathered with gravy which went with gravy coupe and just because red velvet pancake isn t something you can get just anywhere ordered side which brilliant choice gravy coupe good and liked though sound heavy surprisingly wasn t salty overly filling you feel sick eating chicken tender and had nice crispy batter from corn flour and liked fried egg still had runny yolk once you cut into them biscuit soft and big portion which ended up not finishing and liked gravy right amount not ruin overtake different flavor from rest entree also you re spice fan instead tabasco grub jam make their jalapeno hot sauce which killer it s every table it s worth try overall gravy coupe good plate and would recommend anyone enjoys chicken and biscuit but say side red velvet pancake better had lot red velvet chocolate y flavor with drizzle cream cheese frosting and powdered sugar side one pancake by far enough and can t imagine how anyone can eat stack entree them which includes three pancake pancake definitely more dessert item will easy share with someone else since red velvet flavor distinct and bold noms guess better question would wait in line hour again jam cafe probably not jam cafe wonderful breakfast and brunch spot and would advise anyone hasn t before get but after trying out can t say worth hour wait minute sure but hour pushing maybe ask again once jam cafe delivery seattle though now would game changer
