100% make reservation

Pork Ribs
Special of the night: crispy Halibut salad 
Fat tug Oysters
Chickpea fritters 
Smoker Frazier Duck breast

They do switch up the menu because they are a farm to table restaurant which makes it nice since you can get a variety.
The alcohol is also farm to table so you will not find tour typical brand of hard liquor"
Fable,"I couldn't ask for more on a slow night at the restaurant. They were about to close but accommodated us . We were very hungry but didn't wanted to eat heavy so we ordered chickpea fritters n beets salad. N omg... my best chickpea fritters ever. So heavenly fresh n soft to eat. Beet salad was even better. I guess the fresh ingredients flavoured so well. In fact there were many food items that i was tempted to eat but I didn't ( have to watch my big growing stomach)  

I forgot the name of my cocktail but it was delicious n refreshing. There are good deserts as well like cheesecake, toffee caramel truffle . Loved the ambience n decor inside. It was peck clean n all covid precautions were taken. Staff was very gracious n smiling. Would love to go back to try duck dish ."
Fable,"Whoa! It's been a while .
And the wait was worth it. Now Vegan it's been hard to find a really good place for fancy pants dining . I am in love with this place. The food ..everything was perfect. And it's got everything from vegan , vegetarian and blood eaters alike ..
The dishes to start were the chickpea fritters..as for chickpeas and plant based eaters it's a happy marriage . They come as singles and I could have eaten that ×6 for a meal. And the roasted beets were so yummy . 
They had a pasta special for vegans which has pesto and pea shoots on the plate. Fantastic .I love my greens .give me a plate full of greens I'm super happy . 
My pescatarian loves ordered the salmon dish which also sounded amazing except the weird combination of chorizo in it(thought I should add that it shouldnt be on the same plate) could be missed if not paying attention. Not a surprise non-meat eaters would appreciate if eaten . 
All in all it has a little bit for everyone .the prices are a little bit high but I would definitely be back for a date!"
Fable,"Came here for a brunch date on a Saturday around noon and got seated right away but we definitely got the last open seats in the restaurant, so if you're coming, be prepared that it starts getting crowded around then! 

I liked how they have both sweet and savory options on their menu. They offer a variety of different eggs benedicts - we opted for their traditional eggs benny and their french toast! Both were good however, portion sizes were a little small for what you're paying.

Eggs benny was perfectly done - yolk was runny and flavor was good! I really liked these ""rostis"" thats on the side - its like a flattened tater tot - that crispy goodness :) 

Their french toast was one thicc slab of bread topped with mascarpone cream, farm fresh berries, and candied walnuts. This dish was a little too sweet for my liking. I was really impressed with the bread/toast itself - it was very caramelized on the outside but the inside was very soft! Felt like we were eating dessert haha. 

Their staff were kind and patient and helpful! Ambiance in the restaurant is definitely comfortable yet a little fancy and could do for a romantic meal too :)"
Fable,"There are many brunch spots on this stretch of 4th Ave., and Fable has to be one of the better options. They have recently expanded their menu to include frittatas and ""toasts"" (avocado, BLT, etc). I sampled the veggie frittata with creamy goats cheese, asparagus, and a healthy pile of greens on top, served with DELICIOUS potatoes rösti, a side of toast, and housemade raspberry jam. All of the components came together beautifully, and the rösti are more like sophisticated flattened tater tots (in the best possible way!). The darlings of the show in my book, along with that fresh raspberry jam.

Service was warm and efficient. The frittatas are listed as taking 20 minutes on the menu, but everything seemed to be served up with speed. The restaurant itself can seem a bit dark, especially if you're seated near the back, but all in all this was an experience worth repeating in my book. Total bill with tax and tip came out to about $20, which again is Vancouver's magic number for brunch or lunch (sans drinks)."
Fable,"It was such a treat coming to spend the evening in Kits with some life long friends. We planned to have dinner before the fireworks and we're thrilled when we were able to get a spot at Fable last minute! 

The restaurant from the exterior doesn't look like anything special but walking just a few steps inside confirmed that this reservation was a good choice. We walked past the bar in front of the open kitchen and I cannot lie I was a little envious of their seats!! I love cooking and sitting there would have been a dream watching them put out all of those plates of pure pleasure. Haha we did keep walking though, our table was at the back of this intimate and simple modern farmhouse restaurant. 

Our waiter was funny, engaging and efficient. He had a great knowledge of the ingredients used in the menu that is developed from a farm to table concept. I love this type of cooking so it was super enjoyable hearing the great attention to providing food that was as equally delicious as it was fresh and local. 

The drink menu has something for everyone, our husbands don't drink alcohol so having some really creative non-alcoholic beverages was really well received. Haha as was the knowledge our server had of the wine menu, as us girls did enjoy a glass of wine with our meals!

The food was very satisfying! The freshness, the creativity, the presentation, the flavour profiles all bang on! 

Thank you Fable for lending us a seat for such an enjoyable night of great food, laughter and conversation. We will highly recommended and hope to be back soon!"
Fable,"I was really excited about coming here because I've heard so much of it, however, the service was really slow and the food was mediocre. I got the eggs Benedict and it was nothing to rave about however, the hash browns were really good!"
Fable,"Fable has been on my list for a long time and I'm disappointed it has taken me so long to try it out! I love that they support local farms and get fresh ingredients daily. They even have a rooftop garden to grow some of their own ingredients. 
We came here for my birthday dinner and were greeted quickly by the hostess. They have an open kitchen right at the front with bar seating as well as regular tables in the back. 

We were told by the server that their dishes are meant to be family style which for me is the most ideal for trying a bit of everything. 

OYSTER FISH & CHIPS - Each order is only 1 piece of a medium sized beer battered fried oyster on tartar, topped with mini french fries. It was a perfect spoonful of deliciousness. The batter was light and the tartar was a refreshing balance. 

ROOFTOP SERRANO PEPPERS - This appy was quite large for the 2 of us. There were about 16 small roasted peppers in a white foam, topped with some chicharron. The spiciness of peppers are always a surprise but don't worry these range between a little sweet to mildly (2/10) spicy. 

SMOKED DUCK BREAST - Perfectly cooked tender duck breast with roasted parsnip, duck confit croquette and cabbage. The croquette tasted more like a carrot, potato croquette however. 

BC HALIBUT with SHORT RIB  on pea risotto, miso and halibut dashi. This dish was my least favourite because the halibut was overcooked. The halibut was pan fried, leaving the outside crispy but the inside dry. There were only a few small pieces of short ribs but they were quite tender. The pea risotto with the dashi was tasty even with so many peas in it! 

Overall a wonderful birthday dinner."
Fable,Cool diner feel.  Nice setup and good food.  Very reasonably priced.
Fable,"Cute little place for brunch. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday and there was a wait at around noon. We both ordered bennies. Our server was a little frazzled but was super friendly. 

Good service and good food. Super busy on the weekends so I'd recommend going a little earlier if you can!"
Fable,"We stopped for lunch here on our way out of town after the husband read some great reviews. We just popped in hoping there would be a place for us and they did a great job accommodating us. The restaurant has a fun vibe with an awesome and unique chandelier in the center and interesting art on the walls. The whole restaurant is pretty small including the dining area, a tiny little open kitchen, and a couple small bathrooms in the back. They do a good job with the space though and have lots of nice seating. 

Our server was really nice and attentive. They have some gluten free options on their menu and she was able to point me in the right direction. The husband can never turn down a grilled cheese, the little boy inside him wins every time. He was all smiles on the other side of the table as it disappeared so I think it was pretty spot on. I had the burger lettuce wrapped and it was good. 

We had nice service and a quick and pleasant lunch before heading back to the Seattle area."
Fable,"Had dinner here 3 of the 4 nights I was visiting Kitsilano from Seattle. Occasionally I've found Yelp reviews to be overinflated when visiting other cities (looking at you, Portland) however Fable fully deserves the excellent reputation it's garnered.
Food: Favorite entree was a tie between the gnocchi with a double add pork belly and duck breast (seriously, order both!), closely followed by the steak. The steak's crispy potato was understated however the two cheese aligot (aka cheesy whipped potatoes) which also comes with this entree was my overall favorite side, so it balanced out.
Favorite appetizers were the duck meatball and tomato soup, beets were solid. The $3-4 appetizers were cute and flavorful. There is nothing I regret eating and all the price points are reflective of portion size. Overall I agree their pricing falls somewhere between $$(Yelp)-$$$(Google) but when you factor in the amazing quality relative to what you pay I agree with Yelp's classification of $$ for value.
Sat at the kitchen bar and enjoyed watching the plating. I like that the open kitchen concept since it helped me optimize for what to try for subsequent visits. I have no regrets about eating the gnocchi twice and duck/steak once during this trip. However if I come back next things I would order are the sablefish (I overlooked seafood but one table ordered this for 3 of their 4 entrees so going to assume they know something I don't) and get the duck again, only mildly curious about the rissoto or salmon although both looked beautiful.

Usually when I eat out, I straight up optimize for taste/value and am ambivalent to the dining experience but Fable delivered on that too, which I must begrudgingly admit won me over. The restaurant manager not only remembered me when I came back on the second evening, he remembered how I liked my water (I can barely get some places in Seattle to recognize me if I go in once every week, much less care about my preference for non-monetary items). Skipped a night eating there and when I came back, the hostess still remembered where I like to sit. Service throughout the meal was attentive without feeling intrusive, ambience/decor was very nice, I haven't worked in a restaurant before but this place generally seemed to have the dynamics of an engaged and high-functioning team (e.g. servers double-checking plated orders before delivering them to tables, everyone in the kitchen voicing their opinion on what keeps things running well on the back-end). There were also smaller interactions that made me feel like the staff genuinely cared whether I had a good experience (e.g. not blanket recommending the higher-priced or daily special when asked for their opinion between two entree options, I was explicitly reminded not to tip by % when my bill included a gift card). Hope I'll get to visit Vancouver again soon because this was the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy great food after a long day."
Fable,"Fable (dine out)
Date of visit: 1/20/2019

Having previously tried their diner location, we were very curious to try its sibling restaurant.

We started with Fabled Virgin (blueberry juice, pomegranate syrup, fresh grapefuit juice, soda) & Citrus Ginger Soda (Fable made citrus ginger syrup, sode) which was refreshingly tart (wife found it *too* sharp)

We both ordered the ""chick pea fritters"" for appetizers, which turned out to be a delicious 3 falafels with curry mayo and pickled red onions, which lightened an otherwise slightly dense dish with their acidity.

For mains, my wife ordered the sqash gnocchi (with pork belly for an extra $5) while I ordered the seared ling cod.

For her squash gnocchi, the pumpkin seed provided a nice crunch to the dish.  Thats not something I ever thought gnocchi needed, but we really enjoyed it. Being a non protein main, it was a nice, generous portion. Also the reason she added the $5 glazed pork belly, which was also delicious when combined with the hazelnut beurre noisette & ricotta cheese.

My ling cod was perfectly cooked on one side; on the other, the skin was nice and crisp (but perhaps a bit too crisp, as the fish adjacent to the skin had hardened); this was a minor quibble as the flavour was spot on; the mashed potatoes and the cream sauce (wasn't listed on the menu, maybe hollandaise?) all harmonized for a very satisfying dish... Except portion wise. Mine was so small, I stole a good chunk of the Mrs gnocchi to keep from starving.

I realize for higher end meals to fit into a smaller budget, it often leads to dine out menus essentially being tasting menus. I would prefer a higher priced but more ""entree sized"" main.

We ordered 1 of each dessert... initially. Both the lemon meringue parfait and sticky date pudding were mind blowing. The lemon meringue parfait: with London Fog ice cream (yes, probably from Rain or Shine; nearby and tastes identical to theirs) and struesel, perfectly balanced lemon curd. 

We've been hooked on trying different sticky puddings since trying Gordon Ramsey's at his Steak House in Vegas (often with less than desirable results). This one was so good, that it didn't need ice cream to balance it. Whipped marscopone and candied pecans added both texture and dimension.

They were both tiny (they're served in small 2"" jars) but so good... that we ordered another one of each and swapped desserts, for an additional $7 each.

The food was of the highest calibre, but we left hungry. We assumed portions had been shrunk for Dine Out, but it turns out their regular portions are that small. Based on Dine Out alone: 4.5 stars, 8.8/10.

Recommended: the tiny but perfectly executed desserts, gnocchi, chick pea fritters.

Avoid: arriving on an empty stomach.

Fable,Amazing. Can I make a review that short? No? Okay I'll go on. The eggs benny is out of this world amazing. Sauce is perfectly acidic (hate a sauce that's just all fat with nothing to cut through it). This place is hyped up for damn good reason.
Fable,"I breakfast'd real hard during a long weekend trip to Vancouver recently, and one of the few disappointments was a brunch visit to Fable. The service and atmosphere were great, but the food itself really fell short. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

The cozy vibe at Fable was complimented by fast and friendly service, so I really had no complaints. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$12.00 got me the 'Farmer's Muffin', which was essentially an open faced breakfast sandwich. Not an unreasonable price point given the size of the dish. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

So it's here that things stayed grounded during my visit to Fable. This simply wasn't a great dish, and wouldn't in my mind have been much better served as a proper breakfast sandwich. 

 The English muffin itself was fine but nothing special, and that set the tone for the rest of the dish. The eggs? Also nothing special with a bit of standard cheese, and the hashbrown was soft and squishy as opposed to crispy. The peripheral greens and jam didn't do much to save things, and as a whole I wasn't impressed. No Stars. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I had some amazing breakfast experiences in Vancouver ranging from Jam Cafe to 49th Parallel, but Fable didn't quite cut it. No Star."
Fable,"I am personally a huge fan of Fable. My favourite go-to dish is the gnocchi- it is absolutely amazing ! It has such great flavour, and the texture is to die for. They used to serve it with pulled pork, which I miss dearly because personally I believe it combined much better than the pork belly. 
Their chickpea fritters are another one of my favourites- everything is so perfectly balanced out- the garnishes (pickled onion and sprouts) compensate for the heaviness of the frying. And the sauce is absolutely delicious. 
You can always count on Fable for everything to be perfectly cooked (Like their poached eggs ! Always and Instagram-worthy ooze when you cut into it),
There are only two downsides that I can think of. The first might be the fact that it's on the pricier side, but the quality of the ingredients and the effort and detailing given to the preparation of the food make the cost understandable. The second is that sometimes in terms of flavour, the dishes your order (if you try to switch it up from what you usually order) might be a little hit and miss, but this is probably due to the fact that everyone has different flavour preferences. There are so many specials and the menu rotates so often and changes so often that sometimes you might fall in love with a dish just for it to disappear a few months later (*insert broken heart emoji*), but at least this really demonstrates how they focus on having the freshest most in-season ingredients and that they're constantly focused on finding and showcasing the best flavours."
Fable,"I should have listened to the JW Marriot concierge when they pretty much ignored my question when I asked about this restaurant.   This is what happens when you are hangry and you just want to eat.  If you are a regular eater, this place would be just fine for you but for those who are more critical and even want delicious healthy options then go somewhere else.  
I really dont eat unhealthy, processed food so my comment on the food is that it has no good quality healthy options. 
The service is pretty lame, our server was like a zombie but the attitude changes when the bill is served.  The only good service we got is from the hostess.   The place is very loud.  Nothing special here for me.  I will not recommend, I regret I went and I will not be a return customer."
Fable,"We love fable , it's our number 1 restaurant to go to.. the food is amazing .. smaller portions but very high quality of ingredients so it's all worth the price .."
Fable,"Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch.

Cozy homey rustic vibe. Low ceilings and close proximity of the tables made for a pretty noisy atmosphere.

Waitress recommended the scrambled eggs and French toast off the menu. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict special for $18.  I found the Benedict Luke warm by the time it came to my table and the English muffin was a bit burnt.   Overall found it a bit sour for my taste, but the salmon was pretty fresh.

The hash brown side that came with benedict was delicious."
Fable,"I came here not knowing what I was getting into, and I'll admit that this was the best stumble I have had the pleasure of stumbling on.

We were biking through the seaside route as we slowly got more and more hungry. Doing a quick google search of restaurants in the area, we settled on Fable and parked our bikes about a block away. Despite being fully booked and during dinner time, we were able to grab two seats at the bar. When we were seated, the guy at bar asked if we had been there before and later given the run down on the menu. We had a friendly conversation on how we couldn't do drinks as we were biking.

The salmon & broccolini was good, my partner said he really liked the veggies. However, we both agreed that it was the spaghetti & meatball that captured our hearts. Cutting into the duck meatball, we saw the juice come out onto the pasta. It was so delicious that I couldn't hold back my excitement when I was asked how my meal was.

Long story short, I love this place now and I want to come back again to try the rest of their dishes. Great service and amazing food."
Fable,"This turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  Our initial yelp find had us in a long line so 2 of us stayed and 2 went to check out another option.  No wait and farm to table....done deal.  The service was very friendly and the server provided suggestions.  Had my first Ceasar (Canadian form of Bloody Mary...loved the seasonings and flavor). The food we ordered made each person eager to share a piece of their meal ... and each taste supported another reason to come back another time.  1) pork shoulder Bennie....cornbread was the base, the hollaindaise amazing, the pork moist and flavorful,  it had some barbeque sauce which I was hesitant about but it worked!  2) Wes's meatball skillet reminded me of the meatball shop in NY....meatballs moist and tasty with the Italian flavors in the sauce as an added bonus. 3) our sweet tooth son had his French toast which was enjoyed by all...no syrup needed.  4) Johnny cakes was similar to mine except my daughter's pancakes had a cornmeal base...it was oh so moist and had the softness of a pancake.  There was that tasty shredded pork on top..yum yum.  Would we come back?  A definite yup yup."
Fable,"Fable Kitchen is a renowned Canadian restaurant run by Trevor Bird, and I must say that it is soaring at a higher level than any run-of-the-mill restaurant.  The wait is long to be seated at this establishment, however, because of its extraordinariness.  It might be good to make a reservation or to simply wait for some seats to open up by taking a  walk around the Kits commercial neighbourhood.

We ordered four of their evening dishes: chickpea fritter, ""canned tuna"", crispy pork ribs, and pan-seared gnocchi.

All of the dishes were exceedingly tasteful, elegant, and novel. The chickpea fritter appeared to be a simple falafel, but it was much, much more. A potato-like and crispy textures were complemented by its golden sauce and crisp, fresh herb toppings. It was gone in two bites, needless to say.  The ""canned tuna,"" was anything but--and I can't help but appreciate the effective and comedic use of irony here--consisted of fried bread and a gourmet fish dipping. The combination was a hit with us, and it was almost immediately eaten entirely--mostly by me. It was like eating luxury tuna on luxury rice (that's a good thing).  And I haven't even gotten to the ribs, but when I did it was gone in an instant. Whatever the sweet, nectar-like sauce was it was an addicting flavour that I couldn't get enough of. The basil surprisingly went well with the ribs and the tender, savoury beans were an excellent complement to the sweet, crispy ribs. Last but not least is the gnocchi. It is indeed non-traditional, but it is exceptional that it melts away any expectations. It pairs excellently with the smooth, white cream and the yellow squash purée to form a triage of comfort and indelible soothing softness.  To round out an already wholesome dish, soft pumpkin seeds and seared kale are added to the fray to complete this dish. 

This was my first time at Fable, so I was not expecting anything, yet I was blown away by this culinary experience.  Not only was the food great, but so was the service. Not to mention the washroom was clean and spacious with some subtle lighting--perfect for one of those ""bathroom selfies""... Of course, the restaurant itself is great for photos as the wooden beams and red brick make for a vibrant background.

I'll still rate this as five stars because of the masterful food. The portions are surprisingly ""French-sized"", i.e., smaller than what will sate a person with a hearty appetite.

I look forward to trying Fable again, with bated breath."
Fable,"Went to Fable for lunch on a Friday with my husband, it was around 12:30pm and literally there was not another single person in the place! I was surprised but it also meant we got the pick of seat and the full attention of the staff, which was really nice.
I was soooo excited to see that they had a Croque Madam on the menu, one of my favorite warm, cheesy with egg sandwiches. It was amazing! I loved it! It had pickled onion, with two beautifully soft eggs on top and a bacon jam with ham inside. It had a Parmesan foam as well and I wasn't sure what that was going to be like, but it was amazing! A definite must try! 
I like the sweet and savoury breakfast sandwich, my husband not as much. But he still really enjoyed the taste and flavour combination. It was accompanied with a simple fricasee salad that was fresh and had a light oil and vinegar dressing. So happy we tried this place for lunch! Now we'll have to come back for dinner"
Fable,The best salmon and gnocchi with pulled pork. Service is exceptional.Smores is also great.
Fable,"Good eats! The food was super fresh and the portions weren't overwhelming large. Enjoyed the handcrafted pasta which was some of the best I've ever had and we also tried the tomato soup accompanied by a grilled cheese, had a nice and crisp crust. My son had the fable burger and fries, he didn't care for it as it was over seasoned and ate about a quarter of it. Ambience was nice, small restaurant and dimly lit during the day. Offered a wine list however we didn't try as we were returning to work. Overall would recommend for those enjoying fresh and quality food!"
Fable,"Great service and food. We had reservations for 630pm but had arrived really early.  They were able to accommodate my friend and I earlier which was great.

I had the smoked duck breast and my friend had the pasta special.  Sorry but I can't remember the name of it.  The duck breast was tender, juicy and delicious.  It was seasoned with cocoa caraway.  The pickled mustard was a bit different and I didn't think it went with the duck so I didn't use it.

The service was efficient, friendly and very helpful as we asked for recommendations for food and wine. 

My friend hasn't been there before so when we went and had the food, she really liked it."
Fable,"Came here for brunch with a friend. 

Food: 3.5/5
I got the Salmon eggs benny and we shared a French Toast. The Salmon very fresh and the benny was good overall but I don't think it was my style of food. The French Toast though, that was another story. The toast was huge, with lots of different fruits and toppings and the texture is very chewy and sweet! Which I really enjoyed. 

Service: 3/5 
Our server was very impatient about giving us time to order, we said we needed a minute a few times and she always gave us a few seconds before coming back haha. But then during the meal, when we needed service she was no where to be found. 

Ambience: 3.5/5 
I liked the design of the place, very dark and artistic. But the tables were very small, crowded and therefore very loud."
Fable,"Came here on a weekday during the winter holidays for lunch with a group of friends. Place was pretty much empty at 11 so we were able to get a table quickly but it fills up pretty quickly at closer the noon. The ambience was casual and the service was top notch. Our server was attentive, patient, and gave good recommendations on food. 

Overall the food was on the saltier side. The appetizers and vegetables are small-medium sized and good for sharing. 
Definitely recommend: 
- Brussel sprouts: crispy brussel sprouts with a good crunch on the outside. Was not overly oily. Rest of the dishes were on the saltier side but this was seasoned perfectly.  Pistachios added a good crunnchhh 
- king oyster mushrooms: a little heavy on the parmesan side for my personal taste but the mushrooms were very fresh  
Meh: 
- Spaghetti & meatball (ducks): Wayyy too salty. The cream pasta sauce is pretty rich with good flavors but the flavors were overshadowed by the salt. The meatball was a slightly overcooked for duck meat and again very salty. I think if they made a few smaller meatballs instead of one large meatball, it may cook more evenly. 
Drinks: 
- Caesar was decent, pretty standard 

Overall, a good experience and would go back again to try their brunch menu but beware of the salty dishes!"
Fable,"This place is the bomb! I first discovered Fable as a fan of Trevor Bird from watching Top Chef Canada, and was so delighted to realize that my new apartment in Vancouver would be down the street from the restaurant. Fable is my go-to place when a friend is coming to town, a casual night out with friends, or even for a date night. It's also my place for dessert, believe it or not. I rarely ever order dessert at a restaurant unless it's a special occasion, but you MUST try the dessert here!! If you come / live in Vancouver, you gotta try Fable at least once.I'll let the food do the talking, but I'd bet money that you won't be disappointed."
Fable,"After eating the most amazing dinner we talked about coming back for breakfast! So here we are again! It is hard to describe everything we experienced when eating here other than to say that every unique bite is crafted to perfection and so thought out from ingredient to finish.
Our server, Claude, made the dinner even more enjoyable with his quick service and great knowledge of the offerings.
Whenever we visit Vancouver, we will come back. And that is a promise!"
Fable,"Went to fable on Sunday morning for brunch and didn't have to wait for a table. Service was very very nice and fast. This is definitely a ""fancier"" brunch place. So it is a little bit more pricey but they present their food like it's a high end restaurant and fable means farm to table which means that they source everything from local farms. I got the farmers muffin which I did enjoy with a side of bacon. I did liked their black peppered jam it was complimented the sausage so we'll. Their potatoes were nice and crispy and soft in the inside.  Portions are small(for guys mostly), my boyfriend left still hungry, I felt satisfied, not overly full but it was a good enough portion for me"
Fable,"Fable is my favorite restaurant in Vancouver--the food and drinks are superb, the staff and owner are friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is cozy and classy. The seared gnocchi is our favorite dish, and their Old Fashions are amazing. It's best to book a reservation--while they do take walk-ins, it fills up fast. We got in by coming a few minutes before they opened at 5 pm."
Fable,"From the first moment to the last, Fable delivered an incredible experience not only because every dish bursted in flavour but the service was so engaging and fun by the wonderful European gentleman. I think it's a tempered French accent... not Quebecois cause he can actually enunciate words.  

Fable sits on 4th Avenue near Kitsilano Beach.  The dining room itself is quite dim as it sits receded back into the space.  The front section has their open kitchen with all it's glorious smells spilling into the streets.  Though it is very dim, you can still make out the room which is whimsical with it's decor notes from a farm.  The lighting fixtures are pickforks and the walls are exposed bricks with lots of warm golden woods everywhere.  The rooster is found in different spots around the room in addition to standing proudly on their sign.  I have to give thanks to Fable for not cramming in the tables to the point you're sitting on another person.  It's a popular spot as we saw the room always at 90% capacity but I couldnt hear my neighbours conversation all the time.

As I mentioned, the service here was just great.  The gentleman was warm, personable with stories of the dishes, and just enthusiastic. He always had a way of making us laugh with his super dry delivery and then hit you with this infectious giggle at the end.  You had to just smile back.  On top of being just a great person to talk to... he had really wonderful ways to describe each dish.  He clearly had a passion and favourites.  We followed all his suggestions and we were rewarded with a phenomenal night.

Crispy Chickpeas fritters - Dinner kicked off with these crunchy fritters that held a tender and almost fluffy interior.  The curry mayo pops the flavour up with the spices while the pickled onion cuts through creamy curry with a bright bold sweet and acidic kick.  I just loved this as a starter. 4.5/5

Octopus salad - This was their seasonal daily offering and I think they should keep this on the menu.  The plating was pretty but hiding under the wreath of endive, you'd find the plumpest and crispy pork belly pieces with the perfectly charred tender octopus.  How could they get both components so perfectly crispy charred with still keeping everything so supple and delicious to tear into it. On top of those 2 amazing things, they also had the added elements of potato rosti croutons.  This is just really amazing crispy potato shreds in a cube form. Then they top it off with a delicious sauce of cauliflower honey mustard.  You have smokey, meaty, a touch of sweetness, and a kick of spiced heat from the mustard.  Just a great dish.  I could have eaten more of this.  5/5

Charred Beets - Simple vegetables elevated ... I'm not sure how they made this so smokey but that added flavour element kept this from being a boring salad.  The smokiness reminded me of the best smoked ribs in a BBQ.  The heavier char taste was nicely contrasted by the tangy smooth goat cheese and the fresh herbal sauce.  At the end, the natural sweetness of the beets come through.  It's definitely one of the better beet preparations I've had. 5/5

Smoked Duck Breast with carrots done 4 ways - I think its cute but there's a smiley face on the plate for this duck breast.  I think it's very happy it was cooked at Fable cause this was another great dish.  This particular duck was done nicely to medium rare so it had that nice ruby shade inside.  It was juicy and had a right gamey rich meat flavour that goes beyond your regular chicken.  The accompaniment of carrots was so interesting.  It was pureed (creamy and naturally sweet), roasted (tender with some good savour flavour from roasting... it almost tastes like chicken fat), pickled (bright and punchy from the vinegar), and raw shredded (for that nice crunch).  On top of all this there was a sharp caraway mustard seed sauce that paired with it.  Another great dish that I could happily eat again.  5/5

Rhubarb berries goat cheesecake - At this point I was ready to call it quits but the gentleman was kind enough to explain how delicious their desserts were.  With the words of ""rhubarb and fresh berries"" uttered, I was sold.  I like a light fresh tart and berry flavour so this was a perfect end.  The creamy goat cheese cake was a nice base for the hazelnut praline.  The praline so good with its sweet, crunchy, nutty, and a wonderful flavour of caramel.  The cherries were added as a gelee which was a wonderfully concentrated pop of flavour as you had some of the tart rhubarb.  Fresh blueberries were added just in case you didnt have enough fresh berry flavour already.  4.5/5

Fable has a lot of fans in Vancouver and it's completely deserving.  It was the best restaurant I went to during my trip and a stand out with it's interesting use of local ingredients and possibly one of the better service experiences in a while.  Definitely make reservations... you won't be sorry."
Fable,"Food: 5.0 of 5.0
Service: 5.0 of 5.0
Environment: 5.0 of 5.0

This place is phenomenal!!! From the decor, to the service down to the food, everything here is spectacular :) 

Before we jump into the food review, I want to preface this by describing how hungry we were. We hadn't eaten anything for 20 hours! We ordered the Kimchi Fried Chicken and the Rutabaga Tagliatelle, ooomph! Both were wonderfully delicous, fresh, and a perfect portion size. The combination of ingredients compliment each other very well. We left feeling satiated and satisfied!

The warm friendly service along with the romantic farm to table themed interior makes for a great date spot but is casual/professional enough to hold business oriented gatherings. Keep up the delicious food and spot on service!"
Fable,"This was our first stop on our day trip in Vancouver. I have to admit, parking was kind of hard to find so try and get there early if you can.

The restaurant itself was smaller than I expected but it was still very accommodating. The food tasted great. I got to try out their fish Benedict right before they ran out! And I highly recommend it."
Fable,"Stopped by here with a few friends for brunch as it was somewhere I wanted to try out and heard good things about it.

First thing, our server was quite blunt and rude. She pretty much indirectly told my boyfriend he was fat and would need to order a dish that had more food on it for him. She continued to make insulting comments to him throughout the meal that I don't even remember what they were because I was so baffled. I'm not sure if she was trying to hit on him or be funny? Anyways...

Prices are a bit high for what you get. I got the scrambled eggs with parmesan foam. It was good but it was in the smallest mason jar and the portions were small. I'm a big eater but for the price and portion size, it was not worth it. Will not be going back"
Fable,"Came here for an evening dinner treat-myself sort of adventure and Fable did not disappoint! I arrived as a party for one mid week, so that likely made seating easy. The food was simply amazing. They pulled off a simple off-menu garden salad, (to much of the next table's surprise or envy) and I had a succulent smoked duck breast to follow. My server made sure I had a fantastic evening and needless to say, I will be holding them in high regards and back for more."
Fable,"Where does one even begin to say how amazing this place was? I don't know how we were lucky enough to find this place but we have been visiting from Chicago for one week and nothing has compared to Fable! From the coziness of the restaurant, the amazing wait staff and the incredible food, there is nothing bad to be said about this place.  

We started with focaccia with a delicious tomato jalapeño butter, incredible chickpea fritters and the spaghetti duck meatball with parmesan foam and all were fantastic. We especially loved the curry mayonnaise sauce on the fritters.  We then had oyster mushrooms, a pea gnocchi and the salmon, which they recommended to do medium rare.  Everything was outstanding!  We finished with the s'mores dessert and lemon meringue with London fog ice cream.  Best meal ever!  They change the menu seasonally so it would be fun to visit frequently and sample new items. They also have a great wine selection and use Coravin, and therefore have a large selection of wines by the glass."
Fable,"Keywords: daily specials, unique 

You can feel the Canadian vibes here. (Interior is dark and the place is little loud)

Presentation of each dishes were very unique and visually pleasing. 

I recommend you go for daily specials because they never fail. 

However, If you don't want to give it a go on daily specials, Duck breast steak and desserts are always a smart choice here."
Fable,Went for brunch with friends and the food was ok - nothing really special. I got the steak and eggs and my friend got the eggs benedict. For $25 I was expecting my steak to be a lot bigger - I only got a few slices that was maybe 120g in total? I guess this is Vancouver pricing for ya. The service was fine.
Fable,"Wow! We went for Dine Out Vancouver, and this place was so delicious. I didn't know what to expect when reading the menu, as a lot of the menu items were things that I've never tried. I went due to the farm to table concept and it was conveniently during Dine Out. My appetizer was the Chickpea Fritters. I've never had Chickpea, but every bite was amazing! The Braised Lamb entree was delicious and I tried a bite of the Seared Ling Cod which was perfectly seared and the hollandaise sauce paired well. Lastly, we got the Lemon Parfait and Sticky Date Pudding for desert and both tasted great. Loved that they were in the glass cups and were the perfect size for us. As for the service, it was great! Our server came by several times during the dinner and asked us how our food was, despite how busy the restaurant was. Love this restaurant and will definitely be going back next time we're in Vancouver!"
Fable,"Got here just before 10am opening & glad not many people in line. However, with limited seating inside don't be fooled into thinking it doesn't get busy! By 1030am it was almost full house.

Fable is known for its brand of - 'straight from the farm to the table' with what it offers from their menu. Fresh & wholesome indeed!

We ordered the Benedicts with Oil Hollandaise & Pulled Pork Johnny Cakes - as well as a side poached egg & bacon. I had the Fish option with my Benedicts which comprised of halibut, cod & scallops. Don't forget to add the maple syrup to the bacon = yummy!

I found my Benedicts to be average tasting - only because they were probably the healthiest I've ever had. I'm more of a savory sweet tooth pile the sugar on type! Lol!

The Johnny cakes were amazing - of course I poured on a whole lot of maple syrup & it was an amazing dish! 

Overall the brunch was very satisfying & you don't feel uncomfortabley stuffed afterwards. 

Great atmosphere & attentive service. 

Will have to try Fable for dinner one night."
Fable,"I went to brunch at Fable on a beautiful Saturday morning and it was a great time. We were seated immediately and our server was kind and knowledgeable about the menu. While the brunch menu is fairly small, the special was interesting and the food was satisfying. We ordered the french toast and the ham benedict. The former was quite good- the fresh fruit and berry compote complemented the sweetness of the bread nicely. The benedict was also good, though non-traditional because of the olive oil-based hollandaise. We also had some blueberry and orange juice mimosas. Overall a good time, reasonable prices, and a nice atmosphere."
Fable,"I thought coming at 6pm would beat the crowd but the waitress said that the place was full and it would take at least 30 minutes to get a table for two. We were lucky that two customers at the bar left earlier than expected so we could take their place. Sitting at the bar has pros and cons. It was fun having a close up view of the chefs making the dishes but the proximity to the stoves made my face hot and my clothes smell. Still, the food was delicious and the service excellent. I wonder if good looks is a prerequisite to be part of the service crew here. Most of the staff were dashing! Haha. I had risotto with pork belly. Every bite was yummy. Dessert was a pretty lemon meringue with a nice blend of ice cream and cookies. Might be too sour for some people but was great for me. Next time I'll make a reservation since they accept one!"
Fable,"We just landed in Vancouver and looked up the best Canadian restaurant open and lunch and Fable came up.

If this is what Canadian food is, I'm ready to move here!

The duck meatballs and spaghetti with parmesan foam literally changed my life! It's so rich,but so darn good.  I've never ever had a meatball that was so crispy on the outside, juicy and chewy on the inside.  I can't stop thinking about it.  The pasta was fresh and perfect as well.

Fritters was light and flavorful. Great texture for chickpeas is really difficult and the chef nailed it here.

Roasted beet salad had smoked cheese under it! What a great twist to the beet salad that's at so many restaurants now.  Loved all the subtle flavors.

Grilled cheese sandwich.  They ran out of bacon that day so we put pulled pork in ours. While the pulled pork was awesome, it ended up making it a bit too sweet.  The texture was perfect though and the potatoes were so perfectly cooked.  It tasted like it was sous vide and fried.

Great welcome to Canada meal.  

The Asian waitress was super sweet and the chef was so good looking! She said he won cooking competitions, so we picked perfectly.

Thank you so much for an awesome meal!"
Fable,"Before I say anything, our server for the night (Lisa) deserves an extra special mention.  I wish there was a separate section to give a server a rating.  She deserves TEN stars out of 5! She was incredibly attentive despite how busy it was, paid great attention to detail (i have 5 food allergies), was very warm, friendly, and kind.  Love her ! 

I came here with 2 of my closest friends for a special occasion (it was the day before my birthday). I made the reservations a month in advance, and I forgot that it was during Dine-Out time.  When we walked in it was extra loud and extra busy, and they sat us down at a tiny table that was really meant for 2 people.  There was no way we were going to be comfortable here.  My friend kindly requested for another table if it was possible.  We were quickly moved to a larger table where we had plenty of room.  We were very happy with how our server was able to fulfill this request!  

Lisa was very helpful with making recommendations for cocktails.  She suggested that we might want to add vodka or gin to the non alcoholic beverages (which I didn't know was an option!).  I forgot the name of it but I got a blueberry/pomegranate drink with vodka.  I like how they use all organic juices and house made syrup!

I ordered the chickpea fritters which was beautifully presented and had the most delectable curry mayo.  I should have probably asked if it was possible to purchase this buy the jar (or by the case).  I could see myself putting it on EVERYTHING!  I also appreciated that whenever Lisa came with each course, she would explain all the elements that went into each dish.  It highlighted that each dish was complex in its own way with very well balanced flavours.  It also just made me feel kind of fancy and special to hear that I was going to eat something so well made and delicious.  Thank you for taking the time to do that Lisa!

For my main course I got the Mushroom Cavatelli with a side of the 48-hour short rib ($8 add on).  I was so glad that I added the short rib because the creaminess of the mushroom sauce and the savoury-ness of the short rib was a perfect pairing.  I had to eat it extra slow because I didn't want the saucey savour-y party to end! 

For desert, i got the lemon meringue parfait, which was presented with a lighted candle for my birthday!  This was such a nice surprise, I truly felt like a birthday girl haha.  I thought it was a really nice special touch to make my night that much more memorable. 

Overall I can see why this place gets RAVING reviews about the fine-dining level cuisine and exceptionally memorable service.  Thanks for making my pre-birthday dinner AH-MAYYYZZZ-INGG"
Fable,"We were sat right away on a Saturday brunch. Service was good. Food came fast. 

Had the ""best brunch caesar"" for $13... wish I stuck with coffee

Had the daily feature which was a Sockeye Salmon Cake Benny with Beet Relish- not great for $21. Relish was too sweet. 

Boyfriend had Pulled Pork Jimmy Cakes which he didn't enjoy very much.

I was looking forward to trying this place for awhile but was underwhelmed. I don't think we'll be returning for brunch anytime soon."
Fable,"They were able to accommodate our party of 9 easily! Their brunch menu has very few options, but I was able to find something I knew I'd like. 
I ordered the breakfast sandwich and replaced the hash brown with a side of tomato basil soup. The soup wasn't the best...tasted very watery and def tasted like it came out of a can. The breakfast sandwich, however, was awesome. Thick cut bacon and egg on a large slice of sourdough bread."
Fable,"Fantastic place to eat. We stopped in for brunch and were not disappointed. They have a ""farm to table"" mentality which we love and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Would return when in town."
Fable,"I cant think of a single thing I didnt love. We ate tomato soup with grilled cheese, chickpea fritters and eggs Benedict. I have never had such simple food that tasted so complex. Our waitress, who I'm unsure of her name was so incredibly friendly and attentive (all of them were) and we were never for a moment left wanting. I would (and will) drive the 45 minutes to Kitsalano, just to eat here again."
Fable,"Oh Fable you are Fab! First timer today in this wonderful restaurant. My friend and I sat at the bar which was awesome; we got to see the kitchen in action. All the food looked and smelled delicious from what were were seeing in front of us. I ordered the Fable Muffin - sausage, cheese, scrambled egg, tomato and black pepper jam. To die for! My friend got the other most popular brunch item - the scrambled eggs with Parmesan foam! It looked absolutely divine and she confirmed it was. The kitchen staff are so damn calm, don't know how they do it! Such professionals. The serving staff was also a delight to chat with. You can tell they too love the products they serve and sell. If you're a local or visiting Vancity, this is a must visit!"
Fable,"My taste buds were completely shocked by how AMAZING and TASTEFUL every dish they serve. The chefs know their stuff. With many flavors going on in each dish, they all complement each other perfectly! My friend and I were visiting from Seattle for two days and we came here for dinner for both of those nights. 

I have never had such amazing food! SO PERFECT!

If you're going for dinner, you MUST get their roasted duck dish! I could not stop raving about how good it was!! Their chickpea fritters are also amazing! 

NOW GO GO GO!! Don't hesitate and just go! I promise, you wont be disappointed!"
Fable,I came here for a surprise birthday dinner and fell in love with the food.  Reservations are recommended. Staff attentive and friendly. One of my favorites in Vancouver. A must try if you haven't
Fable,"Saw the reviews on Yelp, decided to try it. It's pretty good. Not five stars but definitely four. We ordered the benny and pasta. It was 16 and 23. I would say it's pretty pricy for the items. Taste was good. service was good."
Fable,"Always a good time at Fable. The blacklight martini and the amaretto sour are favorites of mine, as well as their fresh daily pasta, it's all excellent! The s'mores desert is DIVINE. 5/5"
Fable,Service was 3.5/5 and the food a 4/5.   I had one pasta that was to die for (pork bolonese) and the gnocchi was good but I likely wouldn't get it again.   Foccacia good but I'd skip though not my fave bread even at the best of times (though that was more on the dry side vs moist like most foccacia).
Fable,"Always great food and service when I come to Fable. I Been to both Kits and Broadway Fable, never disappoints."
Fable,"Claude, our server gets the tap first because he made us welcome and the service exemplary before we even tasted the food
Dinner on the other hand, was so delicate and delicious that we just about forgot everything else
It's our third time to Fable and it keeps getting finer
From appy to dessert, their ever changing menu has many seasonal highlights"
Fable,"We went here for a late Valentine's Day dinner as my boyfriend and I couldn't celebrate on the actual day. To start off, making a reservation was extremely easy and there was multiple time slots available Friday evening. Don't let that fool you, it was quite busy when we arrived and they squish you like sardines in their strategic floor plan. 

When we first arrived we were greeted by the hostess and seated almost immediately. It's a restaurant on the smaller end and and the tables are so close to one another you literally bump elbows with the guests sitting at the table next to you. However, we didn't have much an issue because we got enjoyment listening to our neighbors's conversation ( which you cannot avoid since you're right next to them) 

Not sure if this is explainable but the decor is that farm to table decor as well as the food. Please keep in mind they change their menu seasonally and what was on their website did not match at all the menu they had that evening. This didn't bother us to much considering we still enjoyed our food. 

We ordered the glazed pork ribs, cavatelli, canned tuna, charred beets, the chef's special greens with blue berry vinaigrette and the lemon meringue dessert. 

Glazed pork ribs- came with about a pound. Has a very good portion of tender juicy meat. Seasoning was on point and had an Asian flair. My favorite dish of the evening. 

Cavatelli- you can tell the pasta is hand made and of best quality. Was on the saltier side but we loved it. Mushrooms were tender and great flavor. 

Canned tuna- marketed as their best selling dish. It was a bit too oily for our liking but still had great flavor. 

Charred beets- absolutely loved this. The beets had that nice Smokey flavor from the charring. The almonds added a very sweet crunch and the cheese paired very well. 

Chef greens special- Highly recommend not getting the greens as it was a small bowl of mixed greens with the dressing that tasted like something you buy off the sale rack at the grocery store  it was very bland and dry not worth the 9 something dollars. We ended up adding it to our beets salad to just give it more flavor. 

Lemon meringue- EARL GREY ICECREAM!!!!!! That was the best part of this dessert. I could have care less about the lemon aspect. Highly recommend just ordering the ice cream 

All in all If I could I would give Fable a 3.5 instead of a 4 due to the lack of urgency from the wait staff. We had to call our waitress every time and even once had to order from a different server."
Fable,"A fantastic spot for a bite to eat. Hollondaise sauce on the eggs benny was to die for! A cozy homey atmosphere with a fairly small local selection makes this place an absolute gem. The wait for food can be a little bit high if you arrive at opening, but the quality of food more than males up for it!"
Fable,"The food and service here were pretty good. A bit expensive because of the ""farm to table"" aspect (organic, ethically raised, local), but it was to be expected. Some people have left reviews that the portion sizes were small...they were small but I expected that for this level of dining. I enjoyed the cornbread, an appetizer and a main course and was too full for dessert. There really wasn't much that was particularly memorable about the food - it was good but not great - which is the reason I can't give it more than 3 stars. 

I do remember that the drinks sounded really unique (and not loaded with mixes or syrups which is important to me), but they weren't as strong as I would have liked. I did appreciate that although they were out of cranberry juice for the drink I ordered, they suggested I get it with local blueberry juice instead. That was nice rather than them saying the drink was altogether unavailable. I also ordered wine with my main course, and the waitress told me that my choice was not suited to the meal I had ordered and suggested a few others to try. I trusted her opinion and tried one of her suggestions but unfortunately it wasn't to my taste. I'm the type of person that is embarrassed that I don't know much about wine so I was too shy to ask for something else (totally on me, not the waitress). I did appreciate her efforts to help me out with a pairing though. 

The location is great and food decent so I'll likely be back!"
Fable,"This is a nice quaint place for a small dinner. I had some duck breast as a main, the spaghetti and lamb sausage with my friends as appetizers. They were tasty and my friends and I enjoyed them. We also had some lemon merengue dessert, which was alright. The staff did remember my birthday and put on a candle, which was nice. I will definitely come back. I have been a fan of Trevor Bird's work since I saw top Chef Canada season 2 and all Stars."
Fable,"Ate at this gem for my birthday recently.

Seasonal changing menu. Amazingly fresh / organic ingredients. Unique dishes emphasizing true western cuisine.

Prices are fair for, paid under 100.00 including tip for 5 dishes, 2 people.

A ""sharing"" style of servings. Great atmosphere and rather busy. However, a little secret from the staff told me, for the quieter crowd the best time is mondays & tuesdays.


Just a heads up, Parking is an issue, Fable does not provide parking in the back of 4th."
Fable,"We had a super lovely meal when we came here with our friends on a Saturday. I especially like the intimate setting, very romantic yet cozy at the same time. We had a late afternoon snack before dinner so we weren't too hungry. The four of us opted to share three entrees - the Angel hair, smoked duck breast, and grilled flat iron. The raisin quinoa under the smoked duck breast blew my mind away. I couldn't stop eating it. Have already tried to find a recipe online to try to recreate it :P Back to the review, everything was so fresh - hence, the farm to table concept. We did find each plate to be on the smaller side.

For drinks, I tried the ""kiss from a rose"" cocktail (I believe that's what it's called). It was refreshing but could be a tad bit stronger. And for desserts, we had the lemon meringue parfait. 

Will recommend and will return!"
Fable,"Wonderful experience! Never sat in front of an open kitchen at a restaurant. Seeing my food being prepared and plated was entertaining. I ordered the pulled pork Johnny cakes. It was delicious! 

Super friendly staff!! I got to try their new menu item (brunch salad) with the compliments of the chef. He was soooo nice and funny! The salad had falafel with a curry dressing. Very unique and tasty!"
Fable,"When you see 600+ votes and and 4.5* rating then you gotta check the place.   Interior is nice and the food is very tasty.  Portions are good size and the price average.   Considering they serve local ingredients and support local business that's another star to that list. Overall I agree with 4.5, so I'll give them 5* rating as well.  I hope to be back soon for that tasty pasta with duck meat balls and fried oysters.  Keep up the good work."
Fable,"My husband and I ate here, along with two of our friends this summer. It was one of the top three meals we have EVER had. So good that we are still talking about it!! The cornbread was to die for (we ordered a second because it was that amazing). Also ordered some of the specials (gnocchi and a few others) and they were incredible. 

If you can eat here for any reason, go. We are ready to go back to Vancouver (from Maryland, USA) just for this restaurant!!"
Fable,"This place never fails to deliver.  Our supper meal was delicious as always.  It was a fantastic Christmas meal - a present from my son. We dined on Gnocchi - roasted squash, squash puree, pumpkin seeds;
Smoked duck breast with walnut, raisins, mustard seed;
Grilled flat iron beef steak with black pepper jam & wild mushroom (the sauce was to die  for); and Pan seared Salmon.  Roasted Brussels sprouts for our vegetable side dish including Lemon meringue parfait & Smores brownie for dessert.  The evening started out with a delicious appetizer of 
Chick pea fritters.  Service was great!"
Fable,"Seems like everyone on the planet has been here except me.

Late for the party.  Again.

From Fuel, to Refuel, to Fable, as it is today.  The transformation has been good over the years.

Came in for brunch and had a meatball skillet right in the middle of the Khats Festival.  Surprisingly it wasn't crazy busy, and I got a seat pretty much right away.  Go figure huh?

Anyhoo, the skillet was good.  Lots of options on the menu including daily specials, but I went for this.  I like my meat.  It came with two poached eggs in a tomato sauce topped with greens.  $17.

Prices are very reasonable for this kinda food.

Repeat is warranted."
Fable,"Oh. My. Goodness. So after reading raving reviews of a few other Vancity gems and then being not so impressed I came into Fable not expecting much but ommerrrrrgahd!!! The food blew us away! I just wanted to sit there and order more, more, more!!! 

Fable is a beautiful representation of FArm to taBLE dining. You walk in and immediately see and feel the heat from the open kitchen at the front entrance to get to the main dining area which is rustic yet elegant. 

We had to save room for another restaurant later that evening and so we ordered two starters and an entree to share. Bad idea. Wish we didn't do that so I could try more things :(

Chickpea fritters: think perfect falafel but with a sweet pickled onion to brake through the fattiness, topped with dressed greens for a bit of freshness and then curry mayo to bring it all together! Love.

Steak tartare: super tasty with a nice punch to it. I (not boyfriend) was a fan of the rice crackers to pick up the meat versus the classic slab of bread. You really get all the flavors from the steak since the cracker is so light!

Smoked duck breast: I never was a huge fan of duck until this dish. Omg you close your eyes and take a little bite of everything together and it's literally a symphony of flavors all going off at once. Melt in your mouth duck breast, with bomb af mustard seed, pickled carrots, and cornbread crouton?!! What?! Amazing!

And after we got our entree I needed more!!!! But I'll have to wait until we visit next time :( my favorite meal in Vancouver so far!"
Fable,The restaurant was crowded but had a great atmosphere. The menu was mainly breakfast/brunch. The service was efficient.
Fable,"There is not a whole lot to say that other reviewers have not already. 
The cocktails were adequate, environment was really good, the Quality of the food was absolutely outstanding. 
This is the kind of restaurant where anything you order is going to be ""The Bomb.com"".
If you are looking for a unique and upper echelon dining experience without the pretentious atmosphere and insane price tag, Fable is probably your best choice in all of Vancouver. 
It is extremely difficult to anoint one restaurant as ""The Best"", however let's put it this way 
if you had guests from outside of B.C. asking for recommendations to dine out, Fable should be in your Top 5."
Fable,"Popular for brunch - advisable to arrive early.

Not a family restaurant, but family friendly -  crayons and toys are available."
Fable,"Fable is Fantastic At Brunch, Let's Eat!

Okay, I actually ate lunch here but it was still fantastic! I was able to get a table for 2 on a Monday afternoon very easily. I was so happy to see the special was the Pulled Pork Egg Benedict (a brunch item!). 

The Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict ($15) came with perfectly soft and gooey golden yolks, tender and well-marinated pulled pork on top of a delicious and sweet corn bread. The hollandaise sauce was mild yet had enough flavour to make me smile and not overwhelm the meat and bread. The Potato Hash was surprising in its square shape but it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside of lovely potato flavour and the creamy dill-like sauce on top balanced the heavier potato taste very nicely. The side green salad was fresh and light in dressing.

We also had THE BEST CANNED TUNA ($12) and it is truly the best canned tuna I've ever had! It's pricey but all that flavour is worth your greens. The huge chunks of melt in your mouth sois-vide albacore tuna is swimming in beautiful flavours of olive oil, lemon and chervil, all on top of a thin, crispy baguette - it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The textures and flavours were wonderful... it would definitely be on my last-meals-on-earth list!

The Chickpea Fritters ($9) were no comparison after I ate the canned tuna but it still had good flavours. The chickpea balls were crispy and nutty, all topped with a curry mayo, pink-pickled shallots and pea shoots were a pleasant taste combo.

The service was wonderful and consistent throughout our entire meal with 2 servers and (I think) the manager serving us - food was timely, waters were always topped up, the preparation of the canned tuna was explained, and the bill was prompt when requested. Upon our leaving, the staff and the kitchen crew were so gracious and said goodbye and thank you as well - how is that for an exit from a busy restaurant?

Overall, deeply satisfied and next time I definitely want to return for brunch so I can truly say, Fable is Fantastic At Brunch, Let's Eat!"
Fable,"Came here for dinner and was blown away. The gnocchi was a highlight, a meal that will not be forgotten. Every flavour was hand picked and combined in such an amazing way, it was truly a treat. And at $24 I would vote it the best dinner in Vancouver for value."
Fable,"FArm to taBLE ... I totally get it and I freaking love this concept! Everything about this place was amazing. The service, the ambiance and the food!!!!!

Let's get started, shall we? 

Drink: The Caesar! A Canadian version of a Bloody Mary, Vodka as the poison. The tomato was more like a cleaner Clamato with a pickled green bean, green olive, lemon pepper rim and lime garnish! The perfect hangover cure. So light, refreshing with the perfect amount of spice. Highly recommend! 

1st course: 
-The ""canned"" tuna: a canned tuna twist that is indescribable, served with toasted, buttered baguette. 
-A chickpea fritter with some really delicious sauce and micro greens. 
-Asparagus salad served with ricotta cheese, mixed greens, nuts and a poached egg. (Amazing) 

Everything was super delicious! Very fresh and presentation was artsy. There was a point where I was lost for words like the rest of my fellow American brunchers and I'm still in a lost for words now. 

2nd course: 
-Steak sandwich served with a potato brioche and a sour cream, chive sauce with mixed greens. 
Steak was cooked medium rare, that melts in your mouth, melted cheese and a sunny side up egg on top of a very crusty bread. So many textures and flavors; it was a ridiculous, delicious concoction. The potato brioche was this thick, not too oily hash brown... O M G! So F'n G O O D!!! 

Dessert wasn't a highlight but their lemon meringue was very light and not too sweet. 

If ever in the Vancouver area and need a very good brunch place, hands down to Fable! You guys killed it!"
Fable,"This was my favorite meal during my visit in Canada!

Service: On point! There were many staff members helping each table and they were really attentive. One we noticed that our table was wobbly, the waitress immediately came by to fix it without us having to tell her.

Food: Mouthwatering! Everything that we ordered on the menu was seasoned to perfection. I just could not stop myself from scraping the plates clean because every component of each dish had such strong, but balanced flavors.

Price: Standard! For a meal like this, I think it was worth paying around $30 USD per person after tip, especially since we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrées, and a dessert.

Definitely recommend and I think this restaurant lives up to the hype!"
Fable,"Food was really creative and interesting. A lot of nice surprises throughout the meal. Service was very friendly and trying it's best to get our food on time despite the rush.
I'd have gave 5 stars if not for the delay between plates and the sudden table cleaning. We were still trying to find out what was in the carotte purée."
Fable,"Yes, yes, yes, yes!!! - what my taste buds were saying during my brunch  I was IN LOVE with the flavours of my dish at Fable, absolutely blown away. 

Although I have a dairy allergy and much of the menu did have some delicious cheese on it, they were able to accommodate me and help me create the perfect plate. I went for scrambled eggs, bacon, dry toast and house made sausage. WOW was I in love. The house made sausage patty was served with a black pepper jam that gave a delightful savoury flavour. The scrambled eggs were soft and the perfect texture - made me believe that I have been over cooking my eggs all these years! 

AND THE BACON!!! The bacon is enough to make your heart skip a beat. I absolutely love bacon and this was so juicy, flavourful with the perfect crunch on the outer edges. It came looking like a bacon cake and I was a little concerned but the second I dove in, my mouth thanked me. I will absolutely be heading back and I hope I've inspired you to check it out as well!"
Fable,WOW! What a hidden gem! So happy to have found this place for a late breakfast while visiting Vancouver and Granville Island.  My friend and I both agree that this restaurant had the best Eggs Benedict we have ever had! The potatoes were cooked perfectly! They were not greasy at all! Staff was super friendly. Highly recommend even if you have to wait!
Fable,"Food 3/5
Service 5/5

We came here pretty late around 9:00-9:15 which is about an hour to closing. They were still busy with more guests coming in as well. I wasn't feel exceptionally well and didn't want to sit at the center of the dinning area so we requested to sit near a corner with the leather seating. As I was speaking with my friend about feeling cold and how I would need to order some hot water, our server overhead me and advised us that she would turn down the AC for me. How considerate! She then gave us the menu and some time to devise on what items we'd like to order. Soon after, she came over to ask if we had any questions and give us a run down of the days menu. 

At last, we ordered:

-Chickpea Fritters (2.5/5): A friend recommended me to get this and I did. It was a bit disappointing to be honest. The outer layer was a bit burnt and overall a bit dry. The greens on top helped salivate my palate. 

-48 hour 'sous-vide' Stilton (3.5/5): This was one of the daily specials. Plating was ok. The veggies looked a bit disheveled at the bottom. The black pepper jam was quite interesting and the sous-vide Stilton was soft and moist. A lot of Asian flavours in this dish. I was not too fond of that, but that's just personal preference. 

-Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli (4/5): Handmade ravioli- Also one of the daily specials. They looked a bit flat though. Presentation wise, not all that great. I prefer the taste of this more than the above. There was a generous amount of duck filling, however I found the taste of the foie gras to be lost. The amount of sauce was just enough and I liked the lemony taste of it. It gives a refreshing touch to the richness of the duck.

I couldn't do with the dessert anymore but I did want to try the early grey ice cream with the lemon meringue. This seems like an interesting combination I've never tried. I wouldn't go all out to dine here again but who knows."
Fable,"I came here for brunch this weekend with my partner. We both tried their special and it was superb. Service was good and like Heather T. mentioned, a bit frazzled but friendly."
Fable,"The server didn't know the menu. She thought the ling cod didn't include a starch - it came with a solid Israeli couscous number - so I ordered a needless side. But the finishing move was leaving the entire order in ""the pass"" for over ten minutes. This, according to the line cook I talked to when I finally noticed the order and walked back to get it myself. So we got soggy, luke-warm food. 

If you're too busy to seat a table or take an order that's fine. But don't take my $120 and then fail to deliver. That's uncool.

Update to respond: I was in the night I posted this review, and certainly stand by its accuracy."
Fable,"Good food and nice people in FABLE  
You should try the spaghetti and meat ball AND the Vanilla ice cream which is not just an ice cream 
I would definitely come back"
Fable,"Food is on the pricier side, but you do get uber-fresh, locally sourced ingredients that can't be beat. 

Ambience is lively and engaging, and even when the place is packed, service is attentive."
Fable,"Just updating information, so rating unchanged.

Last year our dining group wanted to try Fable Kitchen and it turned out that for larger tables, they enforce a group menu with ""served family style"" elements.
It's still the same. I had totally forgotten about it, and when I tried to expand our reservation from 6 to 8, I got ""the e-mail"":

*
""Parties of over 6 guests usually dine on our four course group menu (attached) so our small kitchen can run smoothly. It is $45/person plus tax & 18% gratuity. This is a great menu for parties, as it decreases time looking over menu options and makes for more time to socialize! The menu is personal salad to start, family style appetizers from our popular choices, choice from four of our most popular entrees, and dessert served family style. This is a great menu to sample through all of our most popular items. Menu items do change as seasonal product does, and I know that Chef may well make changes, but the 'bones' of it will remain the same.  We have served this menu a number of times now, to rave reviews. We have no problem accommodating any special requests or dietary restrictions for any of your guests, please let us know of any of these in advance.

We take a $10 per person deposit to hold the seats. If all guests reserved for arrive the night of, or we receive at least 48 hours notice of a change in the numbers, the full deposit will be applied to your bill the night of your reservation. (Or refunded to you the night of if that is preferred.) Please don't be afraid to forward any questions or special requests!

If [friend's name]'s party would prefer to dine off of our regular menu, we could have you in earlier at 6:00 but the entrée and appetizer order must be placed at the same time.

I look forward to hearing back from you!""
*

Notable extra information this time include:
-$10 per person deposit. You get it back if ALL reserved guests show. So no-shows will cost you $10 a butt (since they're obviously a-holes to no-show on you).
-No more family style 3-course $50 per person platter option (or at least not offered up front).

*More importantly, there is a workaround* -- seating by 6pm AND ordering entrée and appetizer at the same time."
Fable,"Here is a sparksnotes review for you: 

What to get: 
- meatball and spaghetti 
- beet dish 

What to avoid: 
- dont tell them you are a vegan, especially if you are not really a vegan. 

Okay, here is the longer explanation: 
Listen, we all deserve good food. But sometimes, we do not want to shell out all the cash. Truth be told, this place is expensive but their appetizers are affordable and DELICIOUS. The spaghetti and meatballs blew my mind. The Parmesan foam was such a perfect cloud of salty goodness that managed to infuse every bite I had. For $12, this is a must for all my 'in-debt' or 'saving-for-a-big-trip' or 'saving-for-a-big-house' friends out there (so essentially everyone). The beet dish was also a delight. It was creative, and the almond sauce was like nothing I have ever tasted before. 

My one complaint was the potato dish that was given to my 'vegan' friend (she likes to try eating vegan, but she isnt strict). She got roasted potatoes for $12 and they were so lame. So long story short, stick to the menu folks. 

A lot of people raved about the chickpea fritters/falafel type things, and I cant say I would order them again. They were good, but they had a very smooth consistency in the center which I am not used to, to be honest. I guess I am more traditional in that sense. 

Otherwise, great service and good vibe. I will be back !"
Fable,"I've had this place in my bookmark for a long time and I don't remember at all why it was there. Anyway, today I decide to try it without making any reservation. We arrived there and there was couple people in front of us waiting for a table that would take really long to be available, so we decided to seat at the bar and we ended up waiting 15 minutes. Not bad for someone that did not do reservation. 

The menu had a lot of attracting options. I decided to have the Gnocchi & onion with pulled pork as main course. This dish was just A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! So good and very filling! Everything was so well done and the onion part gave so much taste to this dish! I didn't have a starter and I was almost refusing dessert, which I didn't! As dessert, I had Strawberry shortcake parfait and the mixture had an interesting taste. I liked it a lot.

Besides that, I had a delicious cocktail which the name had the word ""kiss"" in it, but I don't remember the full name.
:P

Location is very easy, staff was great and the restaurant itself is nice and clean. I definitely plan to go back and try their brunch menu!"
Fable,"Good food. The Brussels sprouts were good for an appy. I had a tasty salmon. It's a bit fancy for a quick bite, but very nice for dinning out. Service was very good."
Fable,"price is a little bit higher than I expected. but food was good. Somehow, the service was slow. We wait for 1hr to get our brunch. But good taste is always the most important!"
Fable,"A friend and I stopped by on a Thursday afternoon. Had heard good things, and being a general fan of the Kits area I decided to finally check it out. 

The concept of Fable is great - farm to table. No worrying about sketchy veggie distributors and knowing exactly where your food is from. 

We were sat immediately and greeted warmly by our waiter who explained the menu and seemed genuinely interested in how we were doing that day, asking about our studies and what we enjoyed doing in our free time. A great alternative to the usual server to customer small talk - made our experience feel really... genuine.

I ordered the pasta of the day (Mealshare! I always try to order it when I see a restaurant has it, and they did so they get an automatic star for that.) 
It was a pesto tagliatelle with turkey chorizo. The flavours mixed together so well!! Delicious. 

My friend got the grilled cheese. My pasta was great, but her sandwich was truly something else. I only had a bite, but I'd say it was probably the best grilled cheese I have ever had. That onion jam though. Wow.

Definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for some comfort food."
Fable,"Delicious. Outstanding, inventive food. Very attentive and well informed staff. Definitely would recommend."
Fable,"Excellent dining experience. No fuss. Quick service. Small menu. Knowledgeable and very attentive staff. And the food was 

We started with the cornbread with special flavoured butter, which was moist and addictive. Then came the Canned Tuna, an institutional landmark dish with good reason - flavourful and rich but never cloying.

Then we had the scallops and pork belly and the special that night, seated need heart in black pepper jelly. Both were cooked and seasoned to perfection and came with nice refreshing salads to counterbalance the umami and richness.

Finished with a shared dessert of poached rhubarb with ginger cake, custard and lavender ice cream.

We were stuffed and happily so. Would return in a heartbeat and recommend to friends.

Overall our meal came to just over $100 (no drinks) but it was completely worth it."
Fable,"This is a must have Canadian brunch.

Parking is a breeze in the residence, but be sure to leave a car's length gap between your car and the stop sign.  Double check permits.

The Pulled Pork Pancakes were a dream and the Eggs Benedict with ham was amazing.  

The savory + sweet + spicy from the picked jalapenos JUST WORKED and the compressed hasbrown was a properly elevated mcdonalds hashbrown farm to table.

The ham in the Benedict was easy to chew and NOT salty like the ham in the US.

Great meal and subtly different from what I've had in the past."
Fable,"Beautifully and creatively plated food that isn't so dainty that you finish your dish hungry.

Brunch: I highly recommend the SCRAMBLED EGGS, which comes in a mason jar and is creamy and delicious. The house made brioche, jam and ketchup give this dish an extra point.

Dinner: The onion GNOCCHI is divine. Plump pieces of dense gnocchi mop up the creamy Soubise and pesto sauce like work of magic. The roasted veggies balance out the dish both in texture and esthetics. Add some tender pulled pork, and you've got yourself a real winner.

Dessert: I would advise AGAINST the lemon meringue parfait. The meringue was much, MUCH too sweet even for my sweet tooth. 

Bottom line: I would come back for brunch and dinner!"
Fable,"Came here for Dine-out and was excited to finally have the chance to eat here.  Service was fine, presentation of the food was great, but sadly, I didn't find that I enjoyed the food itself here that much (at least of the options that I personally ordered - I did like what my friend got).  Since we had a party of three, we were able to try almost all of the Dine-out items so got a good range of what they have to offer (the only thing we didn't have was the lamb shoulder).  

Appetizer wise, I got the chickpea fritters upon our server's recommendation, but I found them to be way too salty.  The greens on top were nicely seasoned, crunchy and fresh though, which was a nice contrast to the fritters themselves though.  I found my friend's roasted squash salad to be much more to my liking though sometimes the contrast in flavors didn't quite meld or felt wanting.

For the entree, I got the paella - again, waaay too salty, a bit oily, the seafood was a little overcooked, and the flavor was a bit too acidic - maybe due to the tomatoes.  Everything was cooked just fine and portion size was good though.  My friend's mushroom cavatelli with short rib was very tasty though - so wish I had gotten that instead.  She basically licked her plate clean!  I would have too haha.

Dessert: I got the lemon meringue parfait - it was ok.  The top tasted more like burnt marshmellow than a light meringue, the lemon curd was nice, but only a couple small spoonfuls worth, and there was a few tiny cookie bits in there as well... but I'm pretty sure they forgot the ice cream.  Sad.  :(.  But I definitely liked the squash cake my friend got much much better.  The presentation was fun, there was a good contrast of flavors, textures and it was just really good.

Drinks wise: i got the wake up - it was a bit too sour for me.  and my friend got the drink above mine but it wasn't my fav either.  

Overall, I'm glad I finally got to see what Fable was all about and Dine out gave me a great chance to do so.  Admittedly, I was expecting much more, especially from what I've heard about the service and food, neither of which I was particularly impressed by, but it was still a good time with good friends."
Fable,"Fable is a solid dining option, but the dishes pale in comparison to other farm to table options, such as farmer's apprentice, forage, and oakwood bistro 

Spinach Eggs Benedict: 
I wasn't a fan of the overly tangy hollandaise sauce, so this dish was a miss for me.

Cavatelli with mushrooms:
The flavors were good, but the portion was very small for $23. I wouldn't mind paying for quality pasta, but the dish  didn't justify the price tag. We also opted to add pork belly for $5, but the kitchen forgot to add the meat initially, and then they brought the pork belly over separately on a different plate. The pork belly didn't add to the dish at all."
Fable,"During our trip to Vancouver, I was hoping to have a dinner that embodied Canadian/Vancouver cuisine, which is why I chose to eat here. I appreciate their emphasis on ""farm-to-table"" and using local ingredients to highlight the region's resources.

The place is narrow and feels a bit crowded, but I really like it because it has a warm and cozy feel. Also, the service is great.

Most importantly, the food is great. The prices are a little high and some people might think the portions are small, but I think the entrees are big enough to leave you feeling satisfied without feeling too full and the prices reasonable for the quality.

One thing I really like about each dish is that everything on the plate adds to the dish as a whole. Rather than adding anything as an afterthought or filler, every veggie and sauce contributes to the dish. I enjoyed the sauces so much that I made sure to sop up as much as possible with each and every bite.

We started off with 2 appetizers: the chickpea fritters and tagliatelle and meatball. Both the fritters and meatball were slightly denser than I expected, but still moist enough and tasty. I loved the tangy curried mayo and pea shoots on the fritters. And for the other app, the parmesan foam was light and had a strong parmesan flavor, though I suggest eating the foam quickly before it dissolves. The tagliatelle had a good chew, too.

We all shared 4 entrees: the smoked duck, butcher's cut beef chuck, wild bc salmon, and gnocchi with pulled pork.

While I loved the sweet smokey flavor of the duck, I just wish it was less chewy and the skin more crispy. The few bits of crispy skin were great.

They did a great job of lightly cooking the salmon because it was rare in the middle but cooked enough so that it was moist and very easy to cut through. I would've liked some more seasoning on the salmon itself, but the risotto-like barley and toasted pumpkin seeds were delicious. 

For me the pulled pork seemed like a strange pairing with the gnocchi and was very sweet, but I really liked the mushrooms, and the onion sauce was really good on the gnocchi. The gnocchi are like really large long pillows of creamy potato, perfect for soaking up that delicious oniony sauce.

The butcher's cut of the day was a $30 chuck roast sous vided for 48 hours. It only came with 2 chunks of meat, but the meat was absolutely tender and the thick dark jam smeared onto the plate was sweet and incredible. The small block of potato is great too because it's crispy outside and creamy inside.

Finally, we finished our meal with the smores. The burnt marshmallow topping pretty much tasted like smores, and it was great to bite the marshmallow, ice cream, and crunchy cookie all at once. However, this dessert was very sweet and didn't seem as innovative as everything else we had, so it's not a must order for me.

Overall, our dinner was fantastic, and I really feel like I got a taste of what Vancouver has to offer. The value is good in terms of price versus quality, and each dish seems very carefully thought out and put together. For me, the highlights of the night were the curried mayo from the fritter app, the barley risotto and pumpkin seeds from the salmon dish, the onion sauce with the gnocchi, and the thick sweet sauce on the chuck roast plate."
Fable,"Food: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Came here for brunch before hitting up Khatsalano Fest. 

We shared the French Toast (mascarpone, candied walnuts, seasonal preserves and fresh berries $15) and the Special of the Day (open-faced breakfast sandwich with bacon, tomato, red onion, sunny-side egg with a side salad and hashbrown $16). The french toast was delicious - the edge of the toast reminds me of the center of a cinnamon bun (the best part!), very dense and rich but the mascarpone and the tartness from the berries help cut the sweetness. The SOTD was also really good - the hashbrown was the winner here. The two dishes shared between the two of us was the perfect amount of food. 

I also had a grapefruit mimosa (Anna Spinato organic Prosecco) which was served tableside (I've never seen it done that way before) which was really refreshing. 

I'd be interested in comnig back to check out their dinner service."
Fable,"I have to say the food here is really good. My favorite appetizer so far is the can tuna. Yes the name sound cheap but its not. Its basically albacore tuna with some extra work at my end for mushing and stabbing. You will know what I mean when you order it. But its so yummy on their cracker bread. Wish the bread cracker has less hole in it. Also got the chickpea fritters. Yummy. but I would say the tuna is definitely a 5 star and chickpea fritter, its about a 4. 

For the main course ordered the wild salmon and I was eye enlightened. It was really good. I love the mint and beet puree. So yummy.

last but not least the desert the famous S'more. well the desert was ok. 

I would definitely come back again."
Fable,"One of our favorites for a neighbourhood restaurant.  
- Service has always been fantastic.
- Atmosphere is great, usually because it is always hopping.
- Menu is not huge but what is on it, is great.  

We have tried many different things on the menu but the one item we always start with is the chickpea fritters -  so amazing!"
Fable,"This was a good restaurant, but it was very cramped. Service was very friendly, and the wait to get the food was considerably quick, but the food is all crunchy-granola if you know what I mean, but generally it's a decent restaurant. If you're looking for really good brunch, I'd recommend The Boat House or Seasons in the Park."
Fable,"Finally tried out Fable for lunch with some out-of-town friends. On a weekday lunchtime, they weren't too busy and surprisingly very kid-friendly. Highchairs were clean, they had boosters available and I saw a waiter give the 2 toddlers on the table next to us some toys to play with. Nice. Our waiter played with the baby and was super friendly.

Based on Yelp reviews, we tried the Chickpea Fritters and the Canned Tuna for appies. I'm normally not a fan of chickpeas but these were alright; however it really needed the sauce it came with or else it'll be a bit dry. The Canned Tuna was everyone's fave; raw tuna spread that was a bit sweet and citrus-y that complemented the tuna well. We had to mash it ourselves to mix the ingredients into a spread so make sure you mix it up good to get the right balance of flavors.

For entrees, I had the Vegetarian Taglietelle ($12) with chorizo add-on (+$4). It came with a heavy dose of parmesan ""foam"" which was really too thick to be ""foam"". I was careful not to mix all of it into my pasta. My friend had the same dish and he mixed it all in before trying it out- he felt stuffed after a few bites because it was so heavy. The homemade chorizos had a bit of spice to it but not overwhelming which I liked. I liked the dish but like I mentioned above, mix in the foam according to your taste. Our other friend had the Grilled Cheese. I tried a bite, it was pretty good and better than other restaurant Grilled Cheeses I've had in the past. 

Overall, good service, above average food, would come back for the Canned Tuna alone."
Fable,"Delicious farm to table dining. Great service, lovely space, good food. We got the (in order of how much we liked them) chickpea fritters, roasted BC king oyster mushrooms, benny of the day (bacon), and pasta of the day. Bonus was that we got the table closest to the kitchen, so we could see the end stages of some of the food being prepared, so that was fun too. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Kitsilano area!"
Fable,"Good wait staff, ambience, ingredients. But the prep left something to be desired. The benedicts were missing salt. The scrambled eggs had a glorious parm foam, but the eggs were tough and a bit leathery. The home made sausage was pretty good. But not worth all the hype. The Black Pepper Jam - great concept, pretty innovative. But a tad too heavy on the soy sauce, which gave it an off aftertaste. 

Not a bad place to eat, but not worth the hype, prices and the wait."
Fable,"Wow, this is one of the better meals I've had all year.

Two of us ordered chick pea fritters, octopus salad, mushrooms, ""P"" gnocchi, and duck.  Plus goat cheese cheesecake for dessert. Everything was so delicious. 

Highly recommended to go!"
Fable,"My date decided to surprise me with a booked reservation to this restaurant. It has been on my to try list for a number of years but for some reason, I always ended up somewhere else. Good thing he placed a reservation because the place was packed soon after 6pm.

Service was fantastic. Our server was very on top of keeping the dinner flow going and our drinks were never empty.

We ordered cornbread to share. Unfortunately, I make a better version at home so it was a miss for us. The duck meatball and spaghetti was fantastic though. It should be an entree size as well. 

I ordered the smoked duck breast and my date ordered a beef chuck for our entrees. I ended up liking the beef dish more. I found the hollandaise sauce to be a bit too tangy for my liking. The duck was perfectly done, but I found the sourness of the sauce took away from the duck. Not to mention, it was drowning in a lot of sauce. Some people love sauce so this would be great for those type of people.

We ordered a s'mores to share for dessert. It was beautifully presented. The brownie was very rich that we could not finish eating it. Overall, it was a nice meal."
Fable,"I've tried every eggs benny at all the breakfast hotspots, and I have to say their fried chicken benny has to be one of the most unique/tasty dish! The combination of the sweet ginger + holandaise+ scone+ fried chicken left my tastebuds dancing in glee! The service was decent and she checked on us every 5-10 min. Busy so make sure you come early! 5$ discount if you get the glance pay app!"
Fable,"I love the name Fable.  From farm to table.  Brilliant! 

We had called ahead of time for a table for 3 adults and 1 baby.  When we got there, a high chair along with a child's menu was already set up along with the other 3 adult chairs.  Service was absolutely fantastic from beginning to end.  The staff were friendly, courteous and most importantly, happy.

The food was indeed fresh, inventive and delicious.

Wild Mushroom Risotto - creamy, flavorful and cooked well.

World's Best Canned Tuna - I wasn't impressed and for the price it isn't worth it.  Presentation was nice though.

Flat Iron Steak - the best flat iron steak I've had.  Tender, well seasoned, succulent and a perfect medium rare.

The drinks were on the small side.  I ordered cocktails, but they looked only a little bigger than a shot glass with very little alcohol.  

Even with all these minor issues, I loved it here."
Fable,"Most fun I've had at a restaurant since Agrikol. Tried the fritters, duck meatball with mushroom jus, canned tuna (not what you're expecting), roasted beets, pasta of the day (with pork belly, of course), smoked duck (the highlight), lemon meringue, and the goat cheese cheesecake. All ranged from very good to truly exceptional. 

Cocktail was solid, staff were helpful and courteous, and the atmosphere was just right for my sensibilities. Highly recommend."
Fable,"Upon walking in, this place is pretty unique and had some cool lights hanging above the bar. It was quite busy so that's where we ended up sitting. The kitchen is open so we were able to watch the chefs work their magic. 


Everything was clean and organized, everyone knew what they were responsible for and was nice to see food flowing out of the kitchen. The team definitely worked well and had some good chemistry. 

I ordered the grilled duck. It was good but the meat was a little on the tough side. We had the tomato bisque which had a nicely grilled cheese sandwich in the middle, a nice touch. The other entrée that was ordered was the mushroom risotto.

The presentation of the food coming out of the kitchen was quite nice."
Fable,"We had the mussels as an appy with fries. Nice thick cut potato wedge fries with a good crispy exterior and a moist interior. Mussels served on a plate not a traditional bowl, really large mussels. Also had octopus, fennel, and bacon. Overall seemed a bit heavy as an appy - just a combo of heavy items - may work better as a shared main.

The duck breast was excellent. Crispy skin, moist and juicy with a very nice mustard and carrot purree. 

Unfortunately, the pork was not so great. Unlike the duck, the pork was not juicy - the fatty side was but the flavouring did not carry through to the rest of the meat. Nice thinly sliced apples to which the onions did not match as they were less eloquently cut. The spätzle is really nice. Overall would not recommend the pork.

Cocktail-wise, the amaretto sour and elderflower fizz (?) were both excellent.

Very friendly staff and highly skilled as the bill was ninja'd away from me during a very brief visit to the washroom. Well played fable."
Fable,"As soon as you walk in for lunch, you feel the buzz!  Greeter was energetic.  All smiles even though we arrived quite late for our reservation.  Seated right away, and waiter showed up right on cue and time to welcome us. 

We went with the Benny of the day, with pulled pork slow cooked to a perfect tenderness. A tad more sauce for me would have been nice, but no complaint.  Also tried their creamy tomato soup which was very nice for the rainy day we had. 

This place's motto is from farm to the table, and the freshness is well appreciated. Each bread, each salad leaf, and each egg, was so delightful. 

I shall return for their dinner menu some time. A job well done!"
Fable,"Food was good, you could really taste the quality of the ingredients. However it was nothing super amazing. Service was also a bit slow and waitstaff was not that attentive."
Fable,"3.5 is my rating.
Fable = farm on a table, nice restaurant name. Got excited when I saw the high ratings on yelp, but after my visit I felt like it was slightly overrated.

The Best ""Canned Tuna"" ($12)
It was diced tuna topped with a layer of potato puree and olive oil which you mix all together in the jar, and spread it on the toasted brioche. I like the texture as it's a smooth spread but still has chunks of tuna giving some chewiness. It tasted slightly creamy but lacked a bit of flavor. It was interesting, but wasn't much of my liking and overpriced for what you get.  

Spaghetti and Meatball ($11)
Giant duck meat ball served with tagliatelle and mushrooms, topped with parmesan whip. The parmesan whip was amazing! Really creamy and strong in cheese flavor, mixed really well with the pasta flavor. The waiter mentioned when you cut the duck meat ball juice would burst out, which didn't really happen so I was slightly disappointed. The meat was slightly dry, not as moist as I thought it would be. 

Onion Gnocchi ($21, added pulled pork for $5)
Pan seared gnocchi with burnt onions and fresh mixed vegetables, topped with pulled pork. The pulled pork meat was soft and tender, but I felt like the sauce didn't blend too well with the gnocchi. The gnocchi pieces were thick, dense but soft and creamy, and tasted great with the pesto sauce - flavors were on point. Loved all the fresh ingredients in the dish - the tomatoes, the vegetables, the greens. Really tasty and delicious.

Don't get me wrong the food was delicious. Really like the decor and atmosphere for this place. Service was great too."
Fable,"I've now been here a number of times to the point that it's one of my go to places to take an out of town guest. For that reason, I have to give Fable five stars because I wouldn't want to take out my guests to anywhere less. The last time I was here the service was great as we had a server who obviously knows how to read the customer and was able to make suggestions including the wine. Honestly though, the service is great each and every time I am there. Since they are a farm to table restaurant, their menu changes from time to time but the one thing that remains a constant is their pillowy soft gnocchi. The other must haves are the chickpea fritters and the ""canned"" tuna. Best appies. I've never been to Fable without ordering either of those. If it's good enough for my best out of town guests, it's good enough for you!"
Fable,"Came here with a party of 4 as a recommendation room a friend. The restaurant was extremely busy for a Monday night; luckily we had a reservation (recommended by).

The food itself was delicious. Amongst us, we had the elk tartar, canned tuna, flank steaks, pasta of the day, gnocchi and dessert. The only disappointment was the size of the cocktails, as they seemed much smaller than other restaurants.

The service was exceptional and the prices were reasonable. I'd definitely recommend trying this restaurant and would come back."
Fable,"One of the best lunch spot in West 4th area.  I like the idea of from farm to table; and you can certainly tell the freshness of the ingredients.  

We tried their Benny of the day (with pulled pork); and their cream of mushroom soup.  

The Benny was done nicely; the pulled pork was moist and packed with favour.  Most important of all, the hash brown was unexpectedly good.  It is seriously the best hash brown I ever had.  

The mushroom soup was great as well.  Overall, we had a great lunch with great services.  

Totally recommended to give it a try if you are in the neighbourhood."
Fable,"My husband and I showed up here to have a later night dinner on a Friday night. The hostess and manager were amazing - very nice and promptly seated us.

Our server was knowledgable and very friendly. We ordered a Negroni (my husband - he said it was the best negroni he has ever had - which is amazing as we just got back from Italy) and a Caesar (myself - LOVE the Walters Caesar mix - 1000x better than Clamato and no MSG). We also ordered the Tempranillo to have with dinner and at $9 a glass we thought this was very reasonable, and a tasty wine (gotta love Spanish wines!). I am actually very happy that they don't just have BC wines on their menu - it can be so limiting for people who like good wines.

We ordered the Gnocci with pea puree and pork belly, and the tagliatelle with mushroom ragu as we decided we were going to indulge in some pasta. We also are huge fans of top chef and remember the episode Trevor got voted off on was for his mushroom ragu.. so we thought we would give him a change to redeem himself :) 

The only flaw with the menu in my opinion  was this dish - Don't order the ""tagliatelle"" if you are expecting real pasta.. its rutabaga pasta. Yes. Pasta made from the vegetable. While I definitely appreciate that they have an option for vegans, vegetarians, and paleo/gluten free, they should have obviously marked that on the menu! Even with a GF or V sign.. or maybe a ** with an ""ask your server for details"" - something! They had tagliatelle in quotes, but nothing else and to be honest, neither of us noticed the quotes. 

When the pasta came the Gnocci was outstanding.. probably one of the best either of us have had (even having been to Italy recently). The way that their chef Trevor has combined west coast flavours like peas with local pork belly was truly delicious, and light. The tagliatelle was surprising as it looked like uncooked rice noodles (I hadn't yet realized it was rutabaga noodles). We both tasted the noodles and it wasn't good at all.. it was cold, and there wasn't enough sauce. So I asked the server for the menu again to look and see if I had missed something. Nope.. just quotes around the Tagliatelle. I brought it to his attention when he asked how the food was tasting and he replied ""you should have asked!""

My husband and I looked at each other perplexed.. don't you think YOU should have told us? Anyways, we returned the dish because to be honest, if it had been delicious, I would have kept it! But it wasn't. 

We got the scallops and pork belly as a replacement and it was so delicious. Exceeded our expectations. 

The whole experience was good.. except that one flaw. But we definitely will be going back as it was super tasty and the server was great. Just a warning to anyone else wanting Tagliatelle made with real pasta! lol you have been warned..."
Fable,"Truly good dinner. Was my birthday dinner with our family of 5 and 1 toddler. The staff were kind, attentive, and funny. Our entire group loved their dishes (scallops, pork bolognese, spicy ribs, spaghetti and meatballs with Parmesan foam). We split an order of s'mores and the staff were sweet enough to top it with a birthday candle (thank you for sparing me from the singing! Hahaha!). I will 100% return when back in town."
Fable,"Perhaps three years ago and friend and I went to Fable to try their highly regarded burger for lunch. We were not disappointed; the organic local beef was freshly ground in-house which meant it could be cooked to order. This is a rarity! I ordered mine cooked medium, and my friend had hers medium-rare. We were both very happy as the patties were nicely browned on the outside, mine was pink in the middle, and hers was a pinkish-red. Moist and juicy three-napkin perfection!

I went again yesterday with the same friend and we were both hoping to repeat the experience. We were both disappointed to find that Fable no longer grinds their beef in-house, so they are required to cook the beef until it's well done. As most burger places serve their patties well done, I thought it was a safe bet that Fable's burger should be at least as juicy and flavourful as their competition. Not so! They were both fairly shrunken and dry, mine worse than hers. 

Also, like the first time, I asked if there were any other options than the regular bun. I had mine wrapped in lettuce then, but this time I was told it was not an option. I didn't think it was an unusual or difficult request, but I guess they didn't have any whole-leaf lettuce on hand to do a wrap. 

I ordered it just on the plate with salad on the side. I didn't ask for them to leave off any of the condiments, but for some reason they chose to leave off the sauce which is normally spread on the bun. So not only was my burger dry internally, but it was externally as well.

I would have sent it back but I was very hungry and didn't want to wait. Perhaps if I'd given them another chance, the second attempt would have been better. I suppose I'll never know."
Fable,"I'D LIKE TO GIVE THIS A 6 STAR RATING, PLZ, YELP, PLZ.

I came here with bae on a Wednesday night to celebrate a special occasion. Immediately upon entry, our server was so unbelievably friendly, upbeat, relatable, generous, and attentive to us. She truly defined EXCELLENCE when it comes to providing service. I don't know what her name was but she had very light blond hair that was cut in a short bob (plz congratulate her). She gave us an immediately GLOWING first impression.

It was easy for me to decide what to order once I saw ""PESTO"" and ""GNOCCHI"" in the same sentence. Our server confirmed that this was, indeed, her favourite dish as well and this made me all the more excited for when it did come out. And it came out very quickly so there was not too much anticipation, thankfully!

Once the plate touched down onto our table, I ogled it. I've seen beautiful plating like this on ""Master Chef"" but NEVER before my own eyes. It was like a beautiful, colourful, textured garden filled with zucchini, tomatoes, sprouts, pesto, gnocchi, and a beautiful caramel-coloured onion glaze. 

It tasted even better. I swear that my eyes watered when I first bit into this. It was heaven. The gnocchi was unlike any gnocchi that I have ever had before. They were larger than most and they had a fluffy texture instead of being dense. So, it was LITERALLY like biting into little, fluffy, perfect pillows of heaven. The pesto sauce was subtle but it complemented the onion glaze perfectly, which was slightly sweet but had a roasted component to it. The pesto sauce also complemented the roasted vegetables perfectly as well. Wow, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. This meal was truly a life-changing experience for me.

And then we had dessert and I died. We ordered a s'mores dessert which had crumbled brownie bits, chocolate ice cream, caramel, and a toasted lemon and marshmallow meringue on top. There was every kind of taste and texture imaginable in here: sweet, salty, sour, chewy, crunchy, soft... everything worked so well together. It was an ORCHESTRA of flavours.

Leaving this place, I felt so satisfied on both a physical and emotional level. I felt nourished, cared for, respected, adored, in a nutshell, I felt like a MILLION DOLLARS. I want to come back here all the time. I want cry at every meal. I want to melt into my food. I don't even know what I am saying anymore, their food is so good that it makes you nonsensical.

(AND YES THE CAPS LOCK WAS NECESSARY!)"
Fable,One of the best meals we had all week while staying in Vancouver.  The drinks were great.  The gnocchi was amazing and the steak was outstanding.  The focaccia bread was delicious.  The service was wonderful.  Claude was so passionate about explaining the dishes.  It was hard to choose.  I would definitely come back here and highly recommend it!!!
Fable,"Got the scrambled eggs here and they are AMAZING!!!! The food is extremely rich and full of flavour --thus the smaller portions are appropriate. I got great service and the restaurant was clean. Note that they don't let people in unless the entire party is there (even if the restaurant is empty). 
I will definitely be back!"
Fable,Fantastic restaurant. Our meal was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. The service was equally excellent. Highly recommend.
Fable,"A business meeting suggested we have lunch here and I agreed. Our server was very patient with us - we were talking a lot and took a while to order.

Adam ordered the eggs Benny special - ham I believe - and it looked yummy.

I ordered something with muffin in the title
 1 egg scrambled on and English muffin and a small sausage patty on the other half
 She was kind enough to tell us the jams on both muffins as well as the sausage were house made.

The jam on the sausage side was really tasty, as was the sausage but very salty.  the tomato jam on the egg was overly sweet for my liking. If I could have scraped it off I would have. 

Small potato pancake on plate was very tasty and the salad was fresh but dull. A splash of lemon may have brightened it a bit.not that I know how to cook. But I know what I like."
Fable,"""Do you even know what farm to table means?""

... is what I tell my philistine troglodyte friends who buy pre-packaged produce from grocery stores not named ""Whole Foods."" Also people who've never eaten at Fable.

Joking aside, this place does have all the makings for a Food Network special: organic suppliers, brick wall with hand-drawn artwork, and a nondescript, one-word metaphoric name that's unrelated to food. Still, the food was as memorable as the place was elite. ""Canned tuna"" was very interesting, as was the crab pasta; fresh although a bit on the salty side. Will like return to try more off the menu when in the area again.

As per Vancouver hospitality, service was very friendly, unpretentious. By the way, ""Kiss From a Rose"": A sensitive drink for a sensitive gentleman such as myself. No one made fun of me for ordering three of these, despite that it was fruity, pink, and named ""Kiss From a Rose"""
Fable,"Came to this famous Vancouver eatery for my dad's birthday tonight and we were extremely pleased with both the food and the entire experience. 

As a family of four, we started with some appetizers, the first being the canned tuna which really exceeded my expectations. I actually hate canned tuna but after mashing up the little jar of deliciousness (that i have no idea what it contains) and spread on some light toasts, it was refreshing and tasty! Also, the spaghetti and meatball featured a nice and meaty ball with some perfectly al dente pasta with a creamy and cheesy sauce. Last, we tried their feature which was pork croquettes which were nicely fried and tasty. It also came with some salad greens featuring their nod to local and in season.

For our entrees, I ordered the potato gnocchi with brown butter onion and added pulled pork. Oh my goodness this dish was heavy, decadent and absolutely scrumptious. The sauce was perfectly flavoured with a savoury component that made you going back for more. The gnocchi itself was pillowy soft and the pulled pork was tender and quite a good portion! I also got a taste of the duck breast dish that my mom ordered and the best part was definitely the peas it was sitting upon. They were extremely fresh and sweet in a way that canned peas never are and the duck itself was very nicely cooked. My dad really enjoyed his pork and scallop dish as well saying the clams were very fresh and the sauce decadent but tasty. Finally, my brother got the butchers cut of behind the cow's leg (sorry i forgot the name) that was cooked for 48 hours making the once lean meat very tender. His dish also came with many greens and nicely fried up potatoes.

Overall, the meal was extremely delicious. We loved all the things we ordered and though that the sauces and sides really made the meal amazing. The prices are also reasonable for the food we got and the dishes were very well portioned to keep us full. Would recommend! :)"
Fable,"Came for dinner (with a reservation) as a group of 5. Happy with the ambience and the service. Got a lingcod thing to share and a smoked duck breast for course. Food looked and tasted fancy but was obviously on the pricey side. Not a place I'd necessarily recommend or go back to, but a good one-time experience."
Fable,"let me just start by saying.. gourmet food in canada is definitely pricey!  we were hoping to get a break from the exchange rate but very little did that help us in the land of delicious grub everywhere haha 

so Fable was actually one of the recommendations my friend gave me~ made a reservation well in advance and got a seating for 2 no problem~ when we arrived on a late thursday evening though, the restaurant was packed! so lucky to have that ressie!

so we began with the canned tuna and the duck meatball~ 
The canned tuna was very interesting.  quite fragrant and definitely not your average can of tuna!  very smooth in texture.  though, i do wish the tuna flavor jumps out more.  since it's mixed with potato and olive oil, it delivered a very creamy taste like a spread but imo the aroma of this overpowered the tuna itself a bit.  still very enjoyable and def good start to dinner!

The duck meatball... oolala was certainly one to remember! i savored every bite of it! i recorded a mini clip of cutting up the meatball, but it turned out to be very anti-climatic so yea.. lol didn't post that BUT even though, appearance was so-so~ the flavors were out of this world! along with the pasta at the bottom, each bite was so packed with savoriness.  if you're a duck fan, you absolutely have to try this! 

entree: Duck breast with gnocchi on yogurt sauce
i remember it was tasty.. but wasn't phenomenal.  it is however note worthy that they incorporated the yogurt sauce to add that summer freshness~  the plating and the garnishes nailed the summer theme perfectly.  i enjoyed the dish as a whole.  while they served just a fair portion of the duck, i was hitting the wall with the last bite with the gnocchi and greens on the side.

my friend ordered the steak special that's paired with bok choy and shiitake mushrooms. it was for sure more of a asian fusion dish but still very good!

so overall, it was a very fun dining experience.  i'm not sure if i would make a trip out to kitsilano for Fable.  the fact that rain and shine is next door makes it a big plus! lol i certainly wouldn't mind having that duck meatball again :O~ mayb i'll just double down on that next time and call it a meal! haha"
Fable,"The oyster appetizer we had last night was impressive, I'm not a oyster fan but I will definitely try them there again.  Service there is worth to pay for it. The only thing thats not perfect is they don't have too much wine collection."
Fable,"The only reason I go to Fable is for their decadent Spaghetti & meatball and Antoine's outstanding service! You'll find below the sump up of my 2 previous visits there.

----- FIRST VISIT -----
We showed up without a reservation and were seated at the bar, which was nice.
Antoine gave us the best service possible. He described us every single item on the menu and did his best to help me find a meal that would fit my onion intolerance (which can be hard sometimes).
 
Appetizers
He was so right to suggest the Spaghetti & Meatball. They were by far the best thing of the menu! (5 stars) We also had the octopus salad, but while the dressing and the sunchokes were very yummy, the octopus was chewy, which did disappoint me since I really like octopus. (3 stars)

Main courses
We picked the most 2 expensive dishes on the menu: Halibut and Moroccan Lamb, but it was such a disappointment (0 stars). The Moroccan Lamb was so spicy that the ""spicy proof tongue"" of my boyfriend almost couldn't handle it. As for the Halibut, that was so dry that we couldn't believe it had been cooked with a sous-vide process (supposed to keep moisture evenly). Big time disappointment... until Antoine saw our faces and without a second thought took our plates and gave us the menu to pick something else because he just wanted us to like what we eat (he also removed the main dishes from the bill)! We wanted to play safe this time and took another Meatball that we liked so much.

*Food: 2 stars
*Service: 5 stars for Antoine, but we did think there were way too many waiters for the seating capacity and number of clients.
*Ambience/Atmosphere: 3 stars - It's a nice place and the general atmosphere is good, but it sooooo noisy and since the staff just keeps running it's kind of hard to relax.
*Space/decor: 4 stars - Again, it's really nice but it's so tiny that you do feel the back and forth of the staff in the back of your seat.
*Price: 2 stars - Meatball's price was worth it, but the main dishes definitely not.
FIRST VISIT RATING: 3.2 STARS

----- SECOND VISIT ----- 
We arrived at 9.30pm, without a reservation and were scared that we wouldn't be able to eat since the restaurant closes at 10pm. However the owner (?) reassured us saying that every person coming to the restaurant is welcome to eat as long as he/she sets foot before 10pm.

As we were guided to our table, Antoine, from behind the bar, saw us and greeted us! Well, that's always nice! 

Main courses
Without a moment of hesitation, my boyfriend and I ordered not 1, not 2 but 3 meatballs. The word spread quite fast in the restaurant since Antoine (who was not our waiter) and another waiter didn't hesitate to tease us about it. The ambience was friendly and we liked it!

Hearty, savoury and just unique sum up all about these decadent meatballs. 

*Food - 5 stars
*Service - 4 stars. Many people remembered us which was great, but we did found our waitress a bit pushy bringing the bill a bit too soon. To her defence, I'd say that the restaurant was officially closed when she brought it, but still... many many were still eating.
*Ambience/Atmosphere - 4 stars. Good friendly atmosphere, but like last time, this place is very noisy.
*Space/decor - 4 stars. This time we were seated at a table (we were at the bar last time) but I'm sorry to say that they are all very close to each other, so you do feel a little bit into your neighbours' conversation.
*Price - 4 stars. 
SECOND VISIT RATING: 4.25 STARS

Going back? Without a doubt!"
Fable,Great atmosphere amazing food!! The few items we tried on the brunch menu were delicious. 100% recommend the Eggs Benedict and the pulled pork pancakes. Also the Bloody Mary was one of best I've ever had.
Fable,"Unfortunately a fairly large group (10-12?) was seated at the same time with us. 3 small children, sometimes running around and screaming. So not quite what I was expecting for a Friday night dinner on 4th ave at this price point ($50/person). 

Our server was quite honest and apologized for the delay of our service due to the large group. He comp'd an appetizer dish which was very generous. I think it took almost 35 mins to get our apps, and maybe almost an hour for our mains. By the time the mains finally came out I had already lost my appetite from the waiting. Also, my duck breast was on the rare side, I'm guessing because the kitchen was rushed to catch up on our order.

Honestly I would have preferred eating somewhere else if the hostess that accepted my reso told me there wasn't any availability for my time slot because there was a large group. Our server did however offer a $50 gift certificate to come back which was again very generous but I'm not sure if I would go back. Alot of hype for this restaurant but weak execution."
Fable,"Very impressed with this place. I had the French toast and added a side of sausage. The sausage was very tender and not at all dry or overly fatty.

The French toast with Berry compote and pecans was delicious. It truly hit hit the spot. Service was outstanding. My coffee and water were never less than half full. Value was there and I left with a full belly and a smile on my face."
Fable,"We called and tried to make a reservation for dinner but they were unfortunately booked and was told that we can show up when they open at 5:30pm and just walk in. 

Because of the good reviews, we took our chances and showed up at 5:30pm! There was a small line up but we managed to get a table and was informed by the polite receptionist that we can stay til 7pm, which was long enough to finish our meals. 

The place was really nice and cozy. It's a bit small but well designed and clean. The lighting was good too. Our server was very friendly and gave us a brief orientation of what the restaurant was all about followed by an introduction to their dinner special and a few suggestions as well. He was very attentive despite how busy the place was. 

We got the foie gras and octopus salad to start. The foie gras came in a mason jar with some sort of apple jam and duck skin crumble on top. It was also served with a few pieces of bread. It was really delicious! The octopus salad was the star for me! It had a light char and went very well with the bacon and hummus! Just simply an explosion of great flavours! For main, we got the flat iron steak and the butcher's cut meat. Both were perfectly cooked and served with greens, mushrooms and black pepperjam sauce. I also tried their cocktail called kiss from rose which was light and refreshing! Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert but it shouldn't be long until our next visit. 

What an excellent dining experience! Will definitely come back for more."
Fable,"Fresh, rich, flavorful, succulent, memorable. 
You enter and walk past the cook line, to sit at small natural wood tables in a dark, warm ambiance. Relaxed knowledgeable staff are attentive. Every menu item had some unique or clever ingredient, like my cocktail with cranberry, basil, elderberry and vodka. 
The cod cheek appetizer was flavorful and nicely paired with a tasty marinade and picked onions and butter lettuce. Perfect combination of flavors and textures. 
The main course was gnocchi with pulled pork, and a wonderful array of rich and colorful vegetables. I sampled the duck, too, which was beautifully smoky, not fatty, and had a rich tasty hollandaise. The duck was the better dish of the two but both were wonderful."
Fable,"Delicious farm-to-table food with fresh, seasonal ingredients, decent portion sizes and reasonable prices. This was one of my favorite restaurants on a recent trip in Vancouver and I'd definitely recommend it, and also would come back here again. Come here with 4 people so that you can order a few plates to share.

We started out with the cornbread (4 pieces for $4) which came out warm and was good, but not an absolute must-have. It was a bit on the fluffier side, almost more like a cake. I've had other cornbreads that blow this out of the water, so I would pass and save room for something else off the menu.

Chickpea Fritters ($9) - There were 5 little fritters, which was delicious, with a curry mayo, pickled onions and some greens. They didn't skimp on the toppings, and the fritters paired really well with the curry flavor. If you don't like curry, this you'll want to skip this dish since it's pretty spice-intensive. I really liked this, and it was easy to share.

Ling Cod ($26) - Also delicious, with the homemade duck sausage and squash puree. The fish was fresh and flaky. If you like white fish, you'll like this dish.

Onion Gnocchi ($21) - There's an option to add pulled pork for $5, and the waiter was nice enough to let us add the sous vide stiletto (steak) for $5 instead so that we could try it. I'm sure the pulled pork would be equally as delicious, since you can't go wrong with pulled pork. The gnocchi was one of the best I've had, as it was fluffy and everything good gnocchi should be. With some onions and pesto, everyone enjoyed every bite.

Smoked Duck Breast ($26) - I don't usually love duck that much, but this was done right. Smoky, but not salty, with a sweet apple puree, and quinoa that paired perfectly with it. I would order this again in a heartbeat.

Everything was really delicious, fresh, and unique. I'd come back here again for dinner to try more of their dishes. 4 is a good number of people to come with, since the appetizers and mains are not quite big enough to be shared with a party larger than that. We didn't get dessert, because we went next door to Rain or Shine (they close at 10 pm). 

Make a reservation ahead of time - this place can get busy. We were able to get last minute reservations on a Sunday night by calling in during the afternoon, so plan ahead. I'm sure Friday and Saturday nights are crazy. I'd love to come back here again!"
Fable,"Intense flavors, fantastic presentation, cool vibe.

I came here for dinner on a weeknight and the place was moderately filled. The staff is friendly and straight forward. I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat and my waiter was very good at describing the menu--concise!

I ended up getting sold on the special for the night: spotted shrimp with a thick piece of bacon along with other fixings.

The aroma of this dish made me melt in my seat. The flavors all blended together so well, they controlled the bacon awesomeness so it wouldn't overpower the other ingredients.

I will return then next time I'm in Vancouver!"
Fable,"Excellent food, went for dinner, had the mushroom gnocchi and it was perfect, except I i added bacon or pancetta and it was Crazy thick cuz blocks of bacon which was delicious but a little overwhelming. 

I loved the staff, had this French waiter that was super informative and kept cracking corny jokes, but he really brightened up our dinner. The place is dark and intimate, nice for a romantic evening, but I just went with friends. Cocktails were solid as well, but not groundbreaking. 

Anyway, will def return if I can I really liked my experience here."
Fable,"I love New American cuisine, so during my recent trip to Vancouver, I had to see what New Canadian food is all about. And I am glad I tried it at Fable! Everything was cooked so deliciously, the ingredients were balanced with richness and freshness, service was great, and dinner was priced reasonably. 

We made a reservation for a Friday night, and the hostess informed us that we had to be out within 2 hours. I was a little confused because I'm typically a quick eater. Once the food hits the table, I snap my photos, and then the food is in my belly. The dining experience was so enjoyable, I didn't even realize we were there for almost 2 hours!

The menu isn't very extensive, maybe about 20 dishes total for appetizer, entree, and dessert. There was also a prix fixe menu for just $35, a lot of cocktails to choose from (no whiskey; only gin and vodka), and also non-alcoholic mocktails!

For 4 people, we pretty much ordered half the menu options, I enjoyed every dish, and was overly stuffed!

Here's a run-down of my favorite dishes:
- 'Canned tuna': house-cured tuna in a jar with herbs, potatoes, and oil. It's mashed together and spread on crusty bread. A must-try if you enjoy cured meats like me!
- Tomato soup: paired perfectly with an onion, grilled cheese sandwich. The sammie is served on a shallow bowl, and the soup is poured at the table from a tea pot. The soup is nice and thick, but not overly acidic. 
- Butcher's Cut Special of the evening (Sous vide chuck steak for 48 hours): there were only two slices of steak, cut very thick. I wish there was more! The steak was SUPER tender, and paired so perfectly with a black pepper jam for a little kick, shiitake mushrooms, and bok choy. 
- Roasted duck for two: such a hearty meal with crispy Brussels sprouts, lentils and spicy chorizo, and broccolini. The duck skin was sweet and crispy, and the meat was so tender we could comb it out with just a fork. 
- S'mores: the texture of the homemade brownie was a good balance of crispy like edges and soft like the cake portion! It wasn't overly rich from the brownie and chocolate ice cream, and the meringue was soft and creamy. 
-Lemon parfait: too sour for me, but I enjoyed the London Fog ice cream and streusel crunch. 

The dishes I probably could have done without were the rustic loaf with garlic and Parmesan butter (butter wasn't garlicky or cheesy enough), and the duck meatball (nothing special to me). I highly recommend to give Fable a try!"
Fable,"We were very excited to come here for breakfast, lunch OR dinner, it just looked so great.  We opted for dinner.

The dining room was busy, noisy, and cramped.  This was a Tuesday evening, around 6:30.  Oh well, it's popular.

Drinks were good.  The house focaccia with roasted black pepper butter was a standout.  We each ordered an appetizer and an entree - big mistake.  More on that later.

First courses were the beet and burrata, and the octopus.  I guess we weren't expecting both of these to be overly salad-y, but they were, and they were pretty big.  Like dinner salads.  Loads of greens.  Both were very tasty.

Then came the mains, the pea ""gnocchi"" with ""bacon"" for my wife, and the scallop and ""pork belly"" for me.  ""Gnocchi"" is in quotes because these aren't gnocchi - they're more like big British dumplings.  Bacon and pork belly are in quotes because they were the same thing in each dish - same exact thing, as far as we could tell.  This wasn't a problem for us - we love big chunks of fried pork belly / bacon - it was just weird that they called it two different things.  Maybe one was smoked and the other wasn't, but if so, the smoking didn't work.  

Both of the mains were also loaded with greens.  Heavy, crisp, lightly cooked garden greens like kale, mustard greens, etc.  They were delicious, but man, oh man - someone should warn people that they might be good with just a first or a second course, or maybe two firsts and an entree to share.  It was serious greens overload.

Normally I'm begging to find good greens while traveling - they are definitely here, just know that they're in large quantity.

Service wasn't spectacular - a little rushed, but it was busy.  I'd try this place again, but maybe for breakfast instead."
Fable,"This is one of the best places I've been in to. Ever, I think. The food is fresh, flavourful, fun. Ironically, I didn't like the canned tuna as much as what I saw from other reviews. My favourite thing I ate there was actually the daily soup and bread! It was tangy, creamy tomato soup and perfectly toasted and buttered crisp sourdough. Just perfect. 
I also liked the tuna Niçoise salad and platter as well. Their hash browns are very unique! 
The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. I had a great experience. :) 
Anyway - this place is a must try!"
Fable,"A friend invited me to Dine Out here last year and I really enjoyed our experience - the food was fresh and delicious, and the service was great. Our server took the time to explain the dish including any garnishes. 

I later came back with three others plus a baby for brunch. The server was very accommodating with moving the chairs around and made sure we had enough room with the stroller. 

Two friends got the flat iron steak and eggs, and I wish I had as well! They raved about it. I believe I ordered the hash and eggs which also was good but the steak looked phenomenal. I'll definitely return for that."
Fable,"Finally found a place in Vancouver that has truly delicious food. The salmon lettuce wraps were amazing. The Roasted pea risotto tasted wonderful with all the right textures. 
To top it off our server was wonderful. She was very thoughtful on her food recommendations and wine pairing.
Overall a great place for dinner and we will definitely go back."
Fable,"Here's what you need to know:

- You can only book online for 5:30pm Monday to Thursday on OpenTable, I suggest calling in or arriving early.
- You'll be presented with a fresh sheet. It's pretty. Use it.

The decor is fun, whimsical. It's a small space, so it's a tight squeeze to fit all the anxious foodies in there. One table knocked over several wine glasses on a neighbouring table whilst donning his coat before leaving. There will be lots of side-stepping to avoid bumping into things, take heed.

The flavours are very subtle. The emphasis is on the fresh ingredients - and they DO taste fresh. If you're looking for bold flavours, you won't find them here (at least I didn't) but I appreciated the simplicity of the preparation and the focus on natural ingredients and presentation."
Fable,"Third time here and I wasn't disappointed (although I wasn't totally impressed either). The atmosphere is casual and pretty hip - they went all in with the ""farm to table"" aesthetic that their food focuses on. No complaints about service! I had the ling cod with celeriac remoulade. The cod had a great consistency and was just dry and tender enough to be enjoyable. The celeriac base provided a drastic but interesting contrast to the cod - it was perhaps a little too powerful for my liking. The cod serving was quite small for the price ($22) in my opinion, but what was there was certainly great. Good work once again, Fable!"
Fable,"The food is really good and the service was good too. I ordered chick pea fritters, rutabaga tagliatelle with mushroom sauce and brownie for a dessert. They were all good except when I ordered black tea and took a sip it was so bad. I looked at it and the tea bag was twining... they could use better quality tea to go well with their dessert. But I will go back."
Fable,"Went in with some high expectations but unfortunately, aside from the cornbread, the meal was rather bland and lacking. I ordered the BC salmon and my friend got the duck. Each were lightly seasoned and didn't bring out the flavors that I love so dear in my favorite fish. 

The cabbage was the highlight accent on my dish but aside from that I don't understand what the hype was about.... I got the gnocchi to go and that was much better. I felt like it was drowned with too much flavor but at least it had some. 

If I were you I'd spend your time elsewhere."
Fable,"Just before entering the restaurant our group ran into ""Christopher"" from Gilmore Girls.  

The fact that the meal was the best part of the evening says a LOT ;)

So does the fact that I was too happily distracted to take food pics!

My favourite appy has been the charcuterie plate, but I did not see it on the menu this time.  We had the octopus salad and 'canned tuna'.  Unanimously, the octopus salad was adored.

We decided to share: the duck, the salmon and the potato encrusted chicken.  Next time I am sticking with the salmon and chicken.  The duck was quite good but the other two were extraordinary.  

The accompaniments to the salmon blew our minds and it was cooked perfectly according to the 'fish expert' at the table.  The chicken was like comfort food but upgraded.

I had the 'Kiss from a Rose' cocktail and was mighty satisfied.

Note:  On our recent visit, we had planned on eating somewhere else that doesn't take reservations, and it ended up being closed.  This was the 5th restaurant in the area we tried and we were exhausted and famished.  The staff went to extra effort to get us in and it wasn't a long wait.  We all will be bringing back other friends so they can try out this accommodating and delicious spot."
Fable,"Probably I expected too much.
I made a reservation a week earlier for 3 people and then I got a small little table that is used for only 2 people normally ( I looked around the restaurant and all the same tables that we got were using for only 2 people ..at that time). 

Plus, the server for our table, he didn't try to catch up with us. He just popped up and asked what we want and when we tried to order menu, he really wanted to go away somewhere else. He asked ' Are you ready to order now?' and then I said Yes. I said in my first language to my bf and bf's father, who wants to order first?. It took few seconds.. literally few seconds. But the server, he said, if you are not ready then I will come by later....
What....?! it was only a few second... I've never had this experience in any other restaurants. You can wait at least 5 ~10 seconds.....

After we order items, we planned to order other items so try to keep one menu but the server, he was FORCED to take back our all menus.(He just grabbed and took those while he looked to another place which I don't know where) I did not have any time to say a word. I felt he was really rude. 
Besides him, other servers who tried to bring us food and bills were so kind and nice. I don't know why he was so rush. He is a server to many other people but to me, he was THE SERVER for our table. He needs to remind of that. To me, he was the only way to get service to my lunch and it was not good, pretty bad.

That time was my first greeting to my bf's father... I expected good food and good atmosphere. That is why I picked Fable after searching all the reviews, scores, and menu items. But food tasted not good. I mean... not tasty at all.  Ling cod tasted fishy like the fish is not fresh. So the other seasonings and the sauce were not impressed because of the fishy smell. Egg Benedict... was too pricey compared to the quality. The English muffin for egg benedict was too chewy and ....flat(?) so when I try to cut with my knife, the muffin part was really hard to cut.  But the steak sandwich was pretty good. I like the sauce a lot. The Canned tuna that people recommended was not what I expected. 
If the tastes were great, I would not think about the price. But when we got the bill... I felt like scammed because the price was pretty high for lunch and for that quality... really...

This is my first time to Fable.... But I am pretty sure that I won't come back in near future(maybe little further future..). I always recommend awesome restaurants I visited for my friends and they trust my pick all the time. I will warn to my friends about service and food.

Maybe my expectation was too high ....."
Fable,"Such good food! Three of us had chickpea fritters - the best! Also octopus - delicious! Spaghetti and duck meatball - amazing! Smoked duck breast - fabulous!  And when we saw the lemon meringue parfait at the next table we had to order it, which apparently is how everyone around us then ordered it. Wonderful flavor and textures!
Good wine, good service, great evening!"
Fable,"Yum yum yum! We came here last Friday and what a way to start the weekend! Everything was delicious. We had the:
-Octopus salad
-Chickpea fritters 
-The best ""canned tuna"" 
-Smoked duck breast 
-S'mores desert 
-Lemon meringue 

5/5 for everything. Our server was great, very knowledgeable about all the dishes and the drinks we got were also excellent. This was my third time here and I'll be back for sure! I really want to try their brunch out soon! Thank you for everything Fable!"
Fable,"Seating can be crowded, easy to get a table. Greeting warmly mostly. Service can be meh, depending on who's serving really. Some are definitely more enthusiastic than others. 

Food there has been pretty good. We're always down for farm-to-table restaurants whenever we go out. At this restaurant, we normally order the duck, beef flank, and the ""canned"" tuna for dinner. Food quality has been pretty consistent with the exception of it being saltier with each visit. 

Parking can be limited and we try to look for residential parking so we don't have to fill the meter if we don't have to. With that said, street parking is usually packed."
Fable,"Oh gosh.  Best meal of our girls' weekend in Vancouver.  Absolutely delicious!

The restaurant itself is lively, warm, and welcoming-- not stuffy or too fancy.  Definitely looks like a restaurant that would be about ""farm to table"" cuisine.  :)  Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to choosing the right amount of food and arranging which dish came out first.

We ordered the zucchini tagliatelle and the cornbread (with maple butter) for our appetizers.  That zucchini tagliatelle.  I will be dreaming about it.  Light and so, so yummy.  The cornbread was just okay, but that maple butter took it over the top.  We started eating that stuff by itself.  Delicious!  We then got the onion gnocchi and the lamb tagliatelle (the special of the night) for our entrees to share.  That onion gnocchi.  Amazing.  So soft and fluffy and flavorful.  The lamb tagliatelle was also delicious, although a bit game-y.  I usually prefer veggies dishes, so the other two took the cake for me.  It's a toss-up between the zucchini and the gnocchi as to which was my favorite dish of the night.  Really wish we had tried dessert!  Maybe next time?  :)

Fable, please come to Dallas, TX, USA!"
Fable,Went for Sunday brunch with a girlfriend.  Very mediocre and ordinary food for the price.  I have no clue why the restaurant is famous.  I Won't come back again.
Fable,"Delicious food.
Started with the daily bread special, cornbread with spicy tomato butter. Butter was underwhelming but cornbread was great. Other starter was a pate special, a hit for the pate lovers in our group. 
Entrees included the duck, which was a huge portion, the flat iron steak with roasted vegetable which was a fantastic, the salmon, which was also delicious, and the scallops. Mixed reviews on the scallops- my husband loved them and said they may have been the best scallops he ever had, my daughter didn't care for the scallops but liked the rest of the items on the plate, and I did not like them at all. 
Servers were stretched a little thin and the atmosphere was a bit pretentious which kept this 4 Star review from being a 5."
Fable,I just had lunch here with my coworkers and the food was very disappointing. The portion is very small. The food is tasteless. The wait is long. The price is expensive. I won't ever come back
Fable,"O.K. eggs benedict, not as good as expected. The hollandaise is very thick and not as flavourful as I would like. Cosy interior and nice service."
Fable,"Have been eating at Fable since discovered it a few years ago. I cannot recommend this place enough. Amazing food every single time, the service is outstanding, genuinely warm staff and you could come here on a date, or for breakfast with your little ones. You might have to wait when you arrive for a table however, there is a good reason for that. I'm glad that other people love this place as much as my family and me do. :)"
Fable,"The yogourt parfait was surprisingly good, but other than that there was literally nothing special about this place. Service was fine, eggs benny was nothing special, decor was nothing out of the ordinary. I don't understand the hype for this place. Wont be back.

food 3.5/5
decor 3/5"
Fable,"My friend and I saw the high ratings, and just have to give this restaurant a try. It definitely lived up to its ratings. Right from the start, the restaurant is very beautifully decorated, and the servers were very nice and attentive.

The food was absolutely amazing. Everything was ""farm-to-table"", and I could really taste the freshness of the ingredients. On top of the taste, the presentation was excellent, and everything was carefully plated. I ordered the mushroom polenta (very tempted to order the breakfast served in a mason jar, just because it was so beautiful to look at, but I'm such a huge fan of polenta!) The polenta was very creamy, with an almost soup-like texture. It was very rich and delicious, and they weren't stingy with the mushroom at all. The poached eggs in the middle really completed the meal.

Excellent eatery with very high quality food! Thank you!"
Fable,"Outrageously good food made with love. The duck and sous vide grilled chuck both MELTED in your mouth. Even the sides were all delicious.
Oh. Their house made corn bread with whipped honey butter. I could have eaten 10 loaves of it. Amazing, and just $4 for 4 pieces!!!!
It's not cheap but also not expensive... And for the quality of food that you get, it's a steal. 
Their menu changes regularly and I will be back for more!"
Fable,"I have never EVER seen a kitchen/dining room that was better run than this. Best service I have ever received in my life and I've dined in the best restaurants back home in Montreal...None of them compare to what we experienced at Fable. Everyone works together and greets you. You are being taken care of all the time without being annoyed about it (because let's be honest there is a very thin line that's easy to cross). Best ribs I've ever eaten in my life and we were sitting at he bar in front of the open kitchen and could see all the action. We mentioned being on our honeymoon while reserving and even the bartender came to congratulate us. We were offered a glass of Moscato after buying a round of beers for the kitchen. Dessert was beyond amazing...and to top it all off, they use local ingredients (Farm to table). I'm so in love with this place, I'm mad there isn't one back home. Can't wait to go back. Amazing job guys, keep it up!"
Fable,"This place was really above average.  The food was tasty, service was great, and ambiance was cozy, but the portion size was puny.

My husband got the Spaghetti and Meatballs.  This was absolutely delicious but I wish the portion size was bigger.  For $11, you get a small bowl of pasta with white sauce and one pretty dinky meatball.  The duck meatball was so good.  I don't usually like eating duck but my goodness, I don't know how you make duck taste that freaking good.  When they said that the dish came with one meatball, I had expected a meatball a little smaller than my fist.  Nope... I'd say it is probably a little bigger than the circumference of a Canadian two dollar coin.  He also ordered the duck parfait.  I'm not usually a fan of duck liver  so I didn't try any.  

I ordered the chicken with risotto.  The chicken was very tender but I didn't really like the sauce that went with the risotto.  It wasn't the best that I've had.  I really enjoyed eating the tiny carrots.  For some reason, they were so tasty.   

Our total bill was about $52.  The service was great.  Our waitress was attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what to order.  

They make very yummy food here but set your expectations of the portion size to small."
Fable,"Fable = Fabulous! A to Z five stars! Farm to table, homemade-Gourmet!!  Presentation, taste, service, ambiance everything was perfect! We sat at the kitchen bar and watched the chefs create their ""art"". Wanted to try everything that came out from the kitchen, it looked so good. Came on a Saturday, was very busy but did not feel rushed, the service is very friendly and informative. Eggs Benny with halibut was awesome! Blueberry smoothie was so good I could have 5 more :)  Coming back for dinner ! Stay Fabulous!!"
Fable,"Arguably, there aren't that many good stories that come out of TV reality shows. Fable Kitchen isn't one of those stories.

Don't let the restaurant's small space, or its small menu fool you. This is a heavyweight, competing with the best restaurants across town. 

Restaurants with small menus always catch my attention. It takes a healthy dose of confidence to present a small selection each night, and still keep your patrons happy. I'm sure you'll be very happy after your meal.

Service is top-notch. All of the employees treat you as a good friend. They accomplish this in the middle of a packed and loud floor. You wish more restaurants treated its customers like this -- not with pretentiousness, but with a soothing, professional and warm attitude.

I'm told the menu changes a lot based on what's fresh. So I'll leave you with this: Save room for the ""Oops, I dropped the dessert."""
Fable,"Amazing teamwork for hospitality & gourmet!
First time visiting without reservation but got warm welcome & fast seating when full house packed !
Succulent smoky duck breast & tender octopus salad satisfied my appetite!!!!
Great job Paul & Edwin for your excellent service tonight!!"
Fable,"Came here for brunch with friends and I have to say that it was an absolute delight.  Service was impeccable, and prompt.  Food was delicious.  The server recommended the scrambled egg with brioche bread and I have to say it was top notch.  It was different from other breakfasts I have tried. 

I really appreciated how kid-friendly this restaurant is as well.  My friend has a one year old and they even brought out a box of toys and extra napkins for the inevitable mess.  


I really liked how the tables were spaced out enough that I didn't feel crowded either. 

Overall

Service: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Atmosphere: 5/5"
Fable,"Really nice inside, not really what I was expecting. Very well staffed with high turn over. The menu is a bit small but the food is good. Their spaghetti and meatballs appy is amazing. I think they should creat an entree version. My BF doubled the appetizer so it was an entree size, but then it seemed a little high priced that way. I have their vegetarian pasta which was tasty. The fritters are really good but a bit too much mayo for my liking. I would go back. Give it a try"
Fable,"Good intentions don't make the food taste better. This place gets some spin for being about feel-good food (although that seems like ALL of Canada) and responsible farm to table eating. So then I wonder, why can't aging meat be considered natural? Or adding salt? Or not overcooking my steak? 

Our waitstaffer had fierce red lips but her treatment of us was a bit dismissive and slick. It's great that she could keep so many balls in the air but as one of the balls, we felt no love."
Fable,Solid dinner fare. The staff can be a bit strangely loud - I don't need you to yell what the food is in my face but the food is delicious. I love that the menu changes occasionally. The space is comfortable and clean but a little dark. I have enjoyed everything I've tried here! Definitely recommend.
Fable,"We went here with a big party expecting great food and great service (based on past experience and reviews). We got a breakfast that went wrong at every turn -- we were almost the first party to sit down and dishes we ordered were sold out, our order was skipped over multiple times (people who sat down after us were paid and leaving before we got food), one of the staff kept telling us our food was moments away when it clearly wasn't, and then one of the orders was wrong. Everyone at the restaurant was very nice about it, but it was so many things went wrong that they just wrote us off so they could focusing on salvaging other people's mornings. 

The food was pretty OK. I didn't ever figure out what people think is so special about the place - it's a good enough diner breakfast in a good location. Maybe lunch or dinner is more special, we probably won't be going back to find out.

The staff was cool and nice. Same with the clientele. But this is a ""skip"" for me."
Fable,"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a restaurant. I had the ""Pulled Pork Johnny Cakes"" and the wife tried the ""Meatball Skillet"" -- both were very unique flavor combinations, and delicious. Even the children's ""Big Breakfast"" had sophisticated flavors and presentation. We're all eager to return here."
Fable,"Just have to add my YUM vote to the crowd.

My daughter and I finally stopped by for lunch and it was fantastic.  From the chick pea fritter appetizer to the s'mores sundae dessert, we were pleased.

This is a place that thoroughly engages you, from the conscientious wait staff to the variety of flavours on every plate. Case in point:  for me, the sandwich I ate wasn't totally my cup of tea - but was so well constructed and lovingly made, I must fault my palette before I blame the kitchen!  I ate that sandwich analyzing every bite - it was complex tasting though it had few ingredients.

We were charmed by the wait staff coming to the table to tell us our orange juice hadn't arrived yet...that it was essentially on its way from the farm.  I think my daughter loved that little cup of juice more than any other based on the thought it was coming from a farm especially for her.  That's lovely!

Recommend!  If you're budget conscious, consider lunch.  It wasn't cheap, but not nearly as steep as dinner!"
Fable,"The 4 stars is for the service, as I really didn't feel the food was too great. I ordered the scrambled eggs and it came in a tiny jar topped with melted cheese? There was so much cheese it looked like yogurt.. it seems very ""experimental"". I asked if I could order something else and they obliged me and even sped up my food, so I did appreciate the excellent service there. The eggs benny I ended up with was ok, but nothing special. Unfortunately I don't think the food is really anything special, but again service is fantastic."
Fable,"Thank you yelp for helping me to find Fable!  I don't have enough good things to say about my meal here.  The others reviewers aren't kidding when they talk about how great this restaurant is.

I was a bit worried about getting a table, so I came early.  The hostess was extremely nice and got me seated right away.  My waitress was immediately fun, friendly and engaging - making the meal that much more enjoyable.  She had some great suggestions but was never pushy.

I wasn't going to have a cocktail, but my seat had a view of the bar, and the bartender looked like a man who knew what he was on about.  I ordered an Amaretto Sour made with Vancouver amaretto and bourbon - wow!  It was one of the best cocktails I've ever tasted. 

I saw a lot of reviews on the 'Canned Tuna' and had to give it a try.  I wasn't disappointed.  The combination of flavours in the mason jar was amazing, and went nicely on the toast crisps.  Great size too.

For my entree I had the gnocchi with onion, and it was honestly the best prepared gnocchi I've ever had in my life.  I wanted to lick the plate when I was done.  The gnocchi was seared nicely to add a little crisp, and the sous-vide onions were mouthwatering.

I don't usually get dessert, but when dinner was that good I really couldn't stop myself from ordering the S'mores.  Again in a mason jar, with seared marshmallows on top.  The chocolate ice cream in the middle created a nice temperature change that really added to the taste.  The bottom layer was a bit too chocolately for me, but I bet true chocoholics would go nuts for it.

I'll be coming back to Fable every chance I get!"
Fable,"Such a modern, yet cozy place. I ordered the smoked duck breast dish (medium-well), and it was the best duck dish I've ever had. It wasn't grainy nor chewy, no duck smell, either. All the ingredients in the dish went well together and was very flavorful and well-balanced all together. The only thing I thought was it could've been better if the duck was a little jucier & more moist. Overall, the service, food, and atmosphere were all amazing!"
Fable,"Love this place! A staple - must go if you're spending a day in Kitsilano; and a staple for locals too! I love that use local produce so their menu is seasonal. I haven't been for dinner yet but have been for lunch a handful of times and highly recommend! Their lunch menu is so tasty and affordable! My husband loves their Fable burger with the lot (cheddar, bacon and mushrooms), best burger he's had in Vancouver yet! (Big call I know) I on the other hand have tried something different on the menu every time, today I had the Crispy Rock fish with Thai Salad w sambal - very delicious! My only gripe was that they heaped the Thai salad on top of my crispy fish - which made my fish soggy  they also promised fries with the burger today, instead we got wedges (I'm not a big fan of wedges and I LOVE fries), but also don't mislead your customers?! Other than that - the servers were great and the atmosphere was pleasant, quiet and comfortable."
Fable,"First time at the restaurant last night, absolutely great food and service. Love the fresh ingredients and combinations of flavors yet still taste the hint of individual true taste. 
Would like to go back again and also try breakfast!"
Fable,"If I were reviewing the food only, I'd have given 3 stars. But the service was so exceptional that Fable earns 4 stars.

It was Dineout Vancouver, so there was fixed, 3-course menu. I got the squash salad - roasted acorn and spaghetti squash on greens w housemade ricotta - and my husband got the fried chickpea fritters w curry mayo. Both were okay, nothing earth shattering. I will say, though, the portions of all 3 courses were on the large end.

For main course I got the mushroom cavatelli. It had good flavor, but was so salty I couldn't eat it all. WAY too heavy handed w the salt. My husband got the paella, which was also good but so spicy - and we love spice - that it was also hard to finish. 

The desserts were both good, but we were pretty full by the time they got there we only had a little of each. My hubs had the lemon meringue - very tasty! - and I had this crumble rum cake topped w egg nog ice cream and mascarpone cream. Super rich, but delicious."
Fable,We always try to stop in when we're in town. Love the seasonal menu and fresh ingredients. Staff are friendly and attentive. Food is always great.
Fable,"From cocktails to dessert it was a superb experience.
Service was excellent and fun.
The sirloin with the pepper jam was amazing! Flavours paired perfectly. 
And highly recommend the Brown Butter Maple Cake."
Fable,"Excellent! Best breakfast in Kitsilano. They don't accept reservations, just walk in. We walked here today (Sunday) to try the brunch, based on reviews we saw on Yelp. Delicious, fresh, made in house black pepper jam,  hearty bread, unique breakfast presentation. We ordered the kids pancakes with apple butter, omelette (deconstructed flat egg crepe with bacon/mushroom/goat cheese/onion/salad on plate), scrambled eggs in a Mason jar with Parmesan foam, thick brioche, and a hashbrown cake square. Light and sparkling mimosa, fresh coffee, attentive but not overbearing service. They offered a coloring book and crayons for our daughter. The orange juice is fresh squeezed. Tasty jam. The restaurant and washroom were clean. On the weekend, get there as soon as they open because they fill up quickly."
Fable,"Fable is a five start experience par-exellence! When I first got in I was wondering about my experience but 
when on our way out  through the same door after our meal it was like I didn't want to leave. Everything was amazing. Very friendly crew. Very nice space. Everyone there looked relaxed, confident, and gave us great suggestion from the menu. 
We were 3 people and 2/babies and they made sure to give us a comfortable table and prepared a high chair before we arrived.  Also for such a quality it s very fairly priced. I'll be definitely back and I've been already telling my friends about it. Vancouver needs more fables!"
Fable,"As a man married to a pescitarian I am always challenged to find a charming restaurant that serves amazing fish. Believe me, this isn't an easy activity. In combing through Vancouver's list of restaurants my wife and I came across a short list of restaurants that advertised Salmon as one of their main dishes.

Fable was the one that stood out among the rest and after nearly 2 hours of deliberation. (no joke) we chose Fable as the one restaurant we would choose. It was the simple preparation and the choice not to over season the fish with too many ingredients that made us choose this establishment over any other. 

We made a reservation, which is a must, but arrived just after the selected time. The hostess was nice and didn't even mention that we were late. She sat us right away. 

The environment was loud and boisterous, non-conducive to normal conversation. the decor was very farm-meets-wholefoods. The waiter was quick and very keen on caring for my wife's needs and specific menu requirements. My daughter and I ordered Tomato soup and Poutine. 

We didn't wait long for our food which arrived steaming hot and full of flavor. The tomato soup was mouth watering. The acid of the tomatoes were evenly balanced by the cream and the basil. The salmon was steamed and my wife was so taken by the flavor that she ordered a second helping. 

The restaurant is a must while visiting this beautiful city. All the food is local farm to table, so the menu changes constantly. Additionally, I would highly suggest to make a reservation early in the day or even the day before.

Fable,"We tried 6 dishes and all were surprisedly perfect! My favorite was the meat ball and the canned tuna. We also find a interesting thing in their chef team...They looks so like a super hero team LOL. One looks like a doctor(white curl hair and glasses) who are super genius and takes care with all kinds of invention and weapons. One looks young, funny and fast like the Flash. The one who were doing the dish decoration looks like the Captain and Superman, who's handsome and powerful. One asian guy (always an asian walk-on!) finally some one from the inside kitchen like Iron man, rich, wise and powerful"
Fable,"I've been here twice for dinner and would rate this place 5/5, the problem is I've been here twice for brunch and my friends are not punctual. 

The good: Dinner was good, fresh food, good service. 

The bad: .... sigh... They have a draconian application of the'Seat only when table arrives' policy, and both times I've been there, the place was not full, the first time it was empty, and since I didn't have a choice on my non-punctual friends, the host  had me stand in the narrow entryway like a bad kid in grade school while I could have sat on a table for the whole time I waited. Both times this happened and they had enough tables, and I didn't mind to give up my table if they needed it, but no. So after that, the brunch was not good, and the crappy treatment might of been part of why."
Fable,"This place is amazing. 

The tuna starter and meatball will blow your mind! The steak is always a must and so is the duck. 

Seriously, you've just gotta go try it and you'll be sold for life!"
Fable,"We came for brunch on Saturday without a reservation and were sat immediately, which was wonderful! The food was delicious. We got the meatball skillet and the scrambled eggs. 

The reason why this isn't a 5 star review is because of our waitress. I have honestly never been made so uncomfortable by asking to sub for a different kind of cheese. I couldn't help but laugh and the table next to us were talking about how horrible she was. We talked about it for the rest of the day! Other than that, highly recommend for the food. 

Also, we were from the states so the fact that they accepted all major credit cards was a huge plus!"
Fable,"This was another completely extemporaneous decision after a full day of medical training conferences. 
High ratings and being billed as Canadian Farm to Table attracted us to give it a try.
From the sidewalk entry you are met with energetic activity from the very visible kitchen and eating bar on your left, crowding the entry and your walk to the dining room are culinary smells and excessive but happy noises of eating and talking and laughter.
The staff were exceptional. So very busy. So very team tasked in every phase of dining. 
Ordering was fun and informative. 
The food was extremely good. Flavor profiles I had never experienced and textures that complimented and surprised.
Extremely pleased with the food and the crew! 
So good that even though I was not able to carry on a conversation with my wife without raising my voice this place gets ALL 5 stars. 
I honestly think I may have had a hard time giving only 4 stars if we would have had to resort to writing notes.
You will not be disappointed!"
Fable,"We came all the way from Port Coquitlam as we had heard such good things.  Perhaps it was just a bad night in the kitchen? Luckily we arrived prior to the table of 16.  Water was served immediately but our fabletini's arrived very late, after our first appy was 1/2 finished.  The Fabletini was delicious and not sweet.  I don't know if restaurant has a dedicated bar tender as I saw her also bringing food to the tables, perhaps this is why it took so long to get our drinks.  Our first appy, canned tuna, was OK but nothing to write home about.  The bread that it came with actually had more taste.  The second appy came from the daily specials and was 4 deepfried oysters with tartar sauce $5 each:  This was excellent.  I ordered the BC Halibut which I believe came with short ribs.  The Halibut was overcooked and very dry.  The risotto with peas was more peas than risotto and it was swimming in ""water"", not at all like pictures I've seen with a brown sauce, you would need a spoon to eat it as it was more like a soup.  I've never had such bad risotto.  The unidentifiable meat was hard, dried out and chewy. I make very moist, falling apart short ribs which these small ( very small) chunks were not! I have to laugh as the meat actually looked like ""hard turds"" in the bowl.  I exchanged my meal with my husband as I wouldn't have been able to finish it as it was unappetizing and lacking in seasoning, needed salt or something.  The other meal was off the specials list which was a ragu with rabbit, beef and another meat.  The  pasta with the ragu was supposed to be a rigatoni but my husband substituted for another pasta.  The ragu was tasty but the pasta was overcooked. The ragu was a much better option though then Fables take on surf 'N turf.  Dessert was Lemon Meringue parfait which was tasty, sweet and tart.  I ordered a Montecristo coffee which was well made but the restaurant doesn't have whipping cream so I had to have coffee cream in it.  I would bring my own wine and pay a corkage fee. The wine that I ordered, Sage Hill Pinot Gris was not available.  The restaurant was not full as there were empty tables and the bar emptied out about 8:30.  They do tell you that you have 2 hours to complete your meal when making a reservation."
Fable,"I went here for a weekday dinner with a bunch of friends. We ordered a plate of Charcuterie (special of the day for $20ish) and their signature Spaghetti and Meatball ($11) while I ordered the Gnocchi and Squash with Pulled Pork ($21 + $5). 

Their Charcuterie was decent but nothing special, I would just skip this if I come here again. Their signature spaghetti and meatball is really unique and delicious though, the best dish of the night for me. It was not served in tomato sauce but instead in cream-based, tangy sauce. The meatball itself was made of duck meat and was very tender and juicy. As for my Gnocchi and Squash, while the gnocchi was one of the best I ate, very pillowy, there was way too much gnocchi for me and not enough pulled pork. 

The service was fast, friendly and efficient as expected from a place like this."
Fable,"Love absolutely everything about this place. Its small and popular though, so getting a table can be a challenge. This is where people who love food come."
Fable,Love Fable for brunch! Haven't tried it yet for lunch or dinner but plan to. Sat at the bar this time around & it was an amazing experience to watch the well oiled machine operation of the kitchen! Can't wait to go back!
Fable,"I have been here a few times and were never disappointed.  Everything you order will be above decent, but I have not found a dish that has WOW me that I must return to have it again and again.  The service is always amazing as well."
Fable,"A medley of subtle flavors that delight the palette  i like the creativity that they put in crafting the dishes. From the first bite til the last spoonful I always felt satisfied with what I was eating.

Highlights were the halibut jaw (we got 3 orders) with the lettuce,kimchi,onion wrap - the fish was so tender and the skin so crispy - delicious!
And the 72 hour sous vide beef rump seared quickly in duckfat - yummy!"
Fable,"Lovely farm to table restaurant. Innovative approach to familiar comfort foods. Wish the place was a bit larger and quieter, but food and service are great."
Fable,"This place was a delightful surprise. The menu is not extensive, but everyone in our group of 4 seemed happy with their dish. I had the grilled cheese with pulled pork and it was delicious but really messy. Just dripped grease everywhere. It could have been more thoroughly toasted (bread was barely tan, and only in some places), but it was very satisfying. The crispy potato skins were so crispy that they were almost burned. Just right by me. My husband got the pasta with chorizo and it was amazingly good. I would have been happy with it, and I usually hate getting just a bowl of pasta because so many end up boring. This was not, and it was delicious. The Parmesan foam sounded froofy but was just perfect mixed in. 

All in all, I would recommend this place. It's very cute and even the kind of boring sounding stuff was yummy."
Fable,"Get your comfort food at Fable!

Grilled Cheese pulled pork and Veggie Pasta are both mouth watering....
No one can say that Cheese and Pork don't go together, because this combo was delicious.

This is another example of why West 4th is a great place to eat and shop!"
Fable,"As a self-professed Top Chef fan (including the Canadian edition), I had to make a visit to Season 2 runner-up Trevor Bird's new restaurant- Fable. For those of you who watched the show, you'll know that Trevor came up with the name for the team's farm-to-table concept in the ""Restaurant Wars"" episode. After the show, he took the vision and evolved it into his very own restaurant in Vancouver. Trevor is joined by his fellow contestant Curtis Luk, who is well-remembered for delivering killer desserts on the show!

Bread is not complimentary here but we were craving some, so we ordered a loaf of their house-baked rosemary focaccia ($4). The bread was delicious, but not really worth $4 in my opinion. 

First appetizer was a halibut ""Brandade"" ($10) with chilled tomato, basil. I liked the bright acidity of the tomatoes, but overall this was probably my least favourite appetizer of the night. 

On the other hand, I really enjoyed these chickpea fritters ($9), topped with pickled red onions, shoots and curry mayo. The spices in the fritters were yummy, especially when combined with the curry mayo. The toppings were bright and added a great textural contrast! 

We also ordered the daily special appetizer- salmon tartare ($12). This was another winner! The tartare was amazingly creamy and the flavours were really well-balanced. One small complaint- we could've used a couple more pieces of toasted baguette to accompany the tartare.

Upon skimming the menu, we were immediately interested in the duck breast ($24), served medium rare atop a bed of scallion perogie, fiddle heads and cauliflower. Hands down, this was one of the best duck preparation I've ever had- sweet, savoury and spicy all at once! The duck was unbelievably tender and that seared, fatty crust was to die for! 

In comparison, our other choice of entrée- potato crusted chicken ($19)- was not as impressive. The potato crust was an interesting concept but the chicken wasn't as tender as I'd like it to be. 

For dessert, our server recommended their daily sweet bites ($10), which includes dulce de leche macarons, shortbread topped with chocolate and caramel, and a mini blackberry Pavlova. I couldn't decide which one was my favourite as they were all fabulous! The macaron was delectably creamy, the shortbread cookie was luxuriously rich, and the Pavlova was as light as air! I couldn't end the meal on a happier note!

On the whole, I thought the meal was fantastic. Standouts include chickpea fritters, the duck breast (best I've ever had, no kidding!), and that awesome dessert plate!"
Fable,Smoked duck breast and gnocchi with pea puree were all great tastes! Overal ambiance and service quality are satisfying. Cheese cake with goat cheese tastes great and probably the best option among deserts list.
Fable,"Extraordinary food, pleasant atmosphere. Every dish we've ordered was very flavorful and delicious. Mushroom pasta was a big hit. Broccolini that came as a side with my husbands salmon were incredible as well. Seriously, I could eat a serving of those as an entree and be happy with my meal."
Fable,"Rare that a 4-star lives up to its name.  And not as if they needed ANOTHER review ;)

Food itself is exceptional: ordered the Duck Confit with Kale, and thought how can this taste so good with this rubbery veggie lol.  But they were clever with adding some nicely-done duck skin crunchy bits, and small potatoes, that really gave it that extra punch.  Meat very tender, and lots of it.  Highly recommended.

Otherwise, I was tempted by the burgers, but were sold out that day for lunch, a bit odd.

Anyways, service was good, and while I'd say it's date material, not for the romantic 1st date. 

Nicely decorated though.

With this locale, expect the higher prices for better quality & ambience.  Good for business meeting for 2. 

Amex good ;)

Washrooms nice and spacious, goes with the decor."
Fable,"This review is for Brunch, which I had the pleasure of enjoying there recently.  A group of us attended and were served their group menu, which included the following: 

1. Scrambled Eggs: The best I've ever eaten. When I think of scrambled eggs for breakfast or brunch, I think boring, buffet-style food that the restaurant is trying to pass off in an effort to include eggs on the menu at minimal effort.  Boy, was I surprised at Fable.  The eggs were creamy almost, with a delicate parmesan foam on top and served in cute little individual mason jars.  I loved this concept for a group menu!  Also on the plate was an arugula/spinach salad and a side of 'rosti', which is a fried potato cake topped with a dollop of chive cream.  These were delicious and I could've easily had several of them.

2. French Toast: Normally, I'm not a fan of French toast, so I reluctantly accepted a piece on my plate, and actually left it until last to eat.  I won't be doing this again!  It was topped with a blueberry preserve-type topping and mascarpone cheese, which was a welcome addition and very different from anything I've had before.  It wasn't too sweet, which is usually why I avoid French toast in the first place.

3. Eggs Benedict: We were served an assortment of bennys to choose from, and I split the halibut brandade and the spinach bennys with a friend.  The hollandaise was made with olive oil, which I really enjoyed - and despite being in a large group, the eggs were all cooked to my liking with perfectly runny yolks. 

4. House Toast: No comment on this, as I was too full to have a piece.  

The group menu for 18 people cost $17.75 for 18 people which included everything above as well as the tax & tip.  It seemed a little pricey at first, but after eating everything, I have to say that I thought it was well worth the price we paid.  You certainly won't get this quality and assortment for less anywhere else (that I'm aware of).

I am looking forward to my next meal at Fable in the not-too-distant future."
Fable,"[Storybook Dinner]

 Fable has been at the top of my to-do list for the longest time and I finally had an excuse to go. Getting a reservation for this place isn't easy so I took a gamble on a Monday night - it was still packed.

Once seated, I perused the menu and decided to start with the Duck Basket. This was a seasonal item and included various parts of a duck (including the gizzard) fried and marinated to perfection. It was delicious. For my main, I decided on the Halibut. I appreciate that all their items are sourced locally and it shows in the freshness of the fish. However, the fish itself was overcooked and a tad dry - not what I was expecting from Fable. Disappointed, I decided to sample my +1's Steak Frites. Boy, did I ever order the wrong dish. These finger-shaped morsels of bovine were wonderfully cooked and every bite was a flavor explosion. Dee-lish! Fortunately, portion sizes here are reasonable so even a big eater like myself didn't have to succumb to a Mickie-D's run on the way home. I felt given the quality and portion size, it's average value-wise.

I absolutely love the ambience. It looked like the love child of a chic yaletown restaurant and old Macdonald's barn. The noise level is higher than your average restaurant but adds to the ambience. Service is also excellent - our waitress was bubbly and helpful. 
Would I be back? Possibly for a special occasion but not for your everyday Monday night dinner."
Fable,"Small plates, west coast cuisine. 

Environment: tables close together, loud, crowded.
Service: good but could be more attentive. I sat there all night with one water refill. And water is important because the food is very salty. Sorry that I don't order alcohol- don't mistake that for being cheap. Your food is just too salty! 
Food: limited selection because they make what is in season. It is too salty. But it is really good. And filling. I ordered the duck breast and my partner had the steak. Forgot what we had for appetizer. But you can tell the difference in the proteins- it is really tender and juicy. For dessert we shared the smores. Too sweet. 
Reservations: recommended. They get really busy.

Overall.... if you really want to sell the 'farm to table' approach, why not try to let people taste what 'real food' tastes like without all the salt and sugar? I felt like my taste buds were going through highs and lows (extremely salty and then extremely sweet). Isn't it important to know how good the food is without covering it in salt? I would come back on a quiet weeknight. However, there are a lot of comparable restaurants nearby. Fable is not bad, but wasn't especially memorable with how common west coast tapas restaurants are now. The crowd is also very yuppie. (It's in Kits after all).

Next time I will bring my own water. Because... too salty!!! :0"
Fable,"Came here with my partner and we both thoroughly enjoyed our experience! We attempted to book a reservation for 7pm on a Monday two days before, but their 6:30, 7:00, and 7:30 spots were already full. The place was packed for a Monday evening so I would definitely recommend booking a reservation several days in advance. We got a table for 8pm, and as we arrived a bit early, we decided to have a couple drinks at the bar. I had the Kiss from a Rose which was sweet and delicious. The rose syrup flavour really came through. My partner had a mezcal based drink, and while I am not the biggest mezcal fan, he assured me that the drink was top notch. Cocktails were about $9 and $12 respectively, so not terrible.

As they had given us menus while we waited at the bar, we were able to order our food right away. We got our meals in about 25-30 minutes which I thought was prompt given how busy the place was. Service was also great - everyone working there was friendly and pleasant and made sure our water glasses were always full. I ordered a glass of the rose to go with dinner, and my partner had an Okanagan white. Having come here for lunch once before, we had to once again get the canned tuna to start with because it does live up to the hype. So worth it.

For dinner, my partner had the gnocchi with the pulled pork add on, and wow these were some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. Double the size of your standard store bought gnocchi, it was like biting into a pillowy soft cloud of potato goodness. They were also very generous with the pulled pork, which was a welcome addition. I ordered the smoked duck breast with brown butter hollandaise, walnuts and brussel sprouts. I tasted some of the hollandaise first and I'm pretty sure my eyes closed and I let out a little moan of happiness - oh my god it was so good, such a simple idea but added so much to the dish! Everything else was great too. My duck was cooked perfectly, and I appreciated the parsnip chips on top to give each bite some texture. Our dishes were around $28, so it's a little on the pricey side, but it's a good place to come celebrate a special occasion.

We didn't order the desserts because they didn't seem particularly appetizing to me, but then the table next to us got the meringue and the smores dessert. I had instant regrets when I saw how good they looked. So get a dessert if you're going to go.

I can't complain, so five stars it is!"
Fable,"Was there for a Birthday dinner,15 people.
Food was delicious,our waiter was a funny,very attentive,the only thing I didn't like was a set menu with no option,for example..I hate tomato soup and it was our first course.we only had option on our main dish,I ordered steak and i was shocked,there was 3 or 4 small slices of steak with veggies and 2 little very yummy potatoes.
I generally don't like set menu,I know some restaurants force that to big parties but I think it's crap.
$50 was a little too much for what i got but again food was delicious.
Oh ya and family style dessert ‍"
Fable,"I don't often say ""that was an awesome meal"" so to be able to say this about my recent visit to Fable deserves a 5 star rating.

Had lunch here on a Friday; it was quite busy for a weekday, but it is in Kits and gets lots of foot traffic.  We were lucky enough to to snag the last of the daily specials, so we had this and the grilled cheese.

Daily special - Open faced bacon sandwich: this was so good! Crispy thick back on top of toast with home made onion jam and topped with a fried egg - what's not to love. 

Grilled cheese with pulled pork - now I am not one that usually adds extras on a classic grilled cheese (except lobster or bacon) but his was damn good too! Not too heavy and just the right balance of smoked cheddar and hearty pulled pork. So awesome.

Accompany that with the daily special Italian wine for $6 and very friendly and attentive service, and it was a great day to start my Friday.

Next time, I am saving room for dessert!"
Fable,"I cannot say enough good things about Fable. Their menu, food, service and ambience is all outstanding. My wife and I have had an amazing experience at Fable every time we have been there. Want some of the best cuisine in Vancouver?...go to Fable on 4th!"
Fable,Amazing food.My boyfriend and I came here the other night for the four course dine around Vancouver meal. My boyfriend and I are pretty big foodies and it takes a lot to impress him. We were both wowed by every dish from the Appis to the dessert. It isn't too often you find a restaurant with such care and quality going into every dish. Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable on wine pairings and was a joy to talk to. I think his name was Claude?  It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back.
Fable,"We went to Fable solely based on seeing a few good reviews in Yelp.   Just visiting from out of town and it was the S'mores dessert that got us in the door....but then it was the amazing experience that brought us back 2 days later to try brunch. 

1. If you have the chance - sit at the bar!  This was incredible.  It was like sitting at the Chef's table.  We got to talk with the Chef and all of the prep cooks.  We got to see how everything is put together.  Almost like being on the set of a cooking show.  

2. The food is beyond good.  We tried the smoked duck breast and the gnocchi with onion & pulled pork as our entrees.   We also had the Spaghetti & Meatball for the appetizer.   Everything was SO well put together.  The duck was perfect and just absolutely delicious.  The sweetness of the Onion really came out in the gnocchi.  The spaghetti and duck meatball appetizer was delicious with an amazing parmesan foam.   For brunch we had the Benedicts with Olive Oil Hollandaise; and the Scrambled Eggs: Fable brioche, potato.   Also, the Big Brunch Caesar was delicious - and the bacon was possibly the best I've ever had.   I almost forgot the dessert that got us in the door in the first place - the deconstructed S'more served in a jar with homemade marshmallow that was charred on the top.  It was worth every calorie! 

3. The presentation of the food was really nice.  It wasn't over the top and too fancy / pretentious...but just presented really well. 

4. The staff was so friendly.  We had a blast sitting at the bar and talking with everyone.  The head chef came out and talked with us...and actually served us our entrees.   

Overall, we had 2 amazing meals there during our trip to Vancouver.  I know I will recommend it to anyone I know that is coming to Vancouver or lives there.  I'm so glad that we stumbled upon it...and I guess I have Yelp to thank for it."
Fable,"I had the Mac and cheese and chickpea fritters  Mac and cheese- Is a baked Mac and cheese topped with goat cheese, you can add bacon for an extra $4.  Chickpea fritters- has city mayo, pickled red onions, pea shoots. Really suggest trying the Mac and cheese! Service was amazing, atmosphere was very nice, coffee was okay but food was great."
Fable,"The reason why I picked this place to try coz I saw Top chef Canada and know about Trevor Bird.

I did view the menu online and find the food selections are limited and not attractive. 

My gal friend eats like a bird, therefore, we shared everything that we ordered:

Duck Meat ball in Fettuccine - Creative starter!!  The meat ball was tasty and tender but the fettuccine was bit blend....  
Flat Iron Steak - Steak was cooked perfectly.
Sable Fish - It was SO delicious and smooth.
Opera Torte - Hazelnut and chocolate cake was good and espresso ice cream tasted excellent.

I would say this is great place for casual dinner with such reasonable price."
Fable,"Went for Dinner and here's my review.

The décor
Warm, inviting and decent. 

The service
Our server was friendly and talkative about the weather, not so much the food. 

The Food
The duck was very salty and rich...not a fan of small cast iron skillet. It's tough to slice through the meat that I requested to be plated it separately. The octopus salad was very good.  

Price wise, not to expensive and not cheap."
Fable,"One of my all time favourite places to dine. Always fresh and local ingredients. Innovative menu and the nicest guys who own the restaurant! Can't go wrong with brunch, lunch or dinner options."
Fable,"Wanted to have a Canadian breakfast. Locals recommended a few places and decided to stop here. Food was good, very rich, sweet, and flavorful. A little too sweet for my liking but nonetheless still tasty. I loved the different ingredient pairings. I ordered the braised pork flat cakes, ham Benedict, and eggs. All very tasty. The restaurant had such a great atmosphere, really enjoyed the decor. Very intimate setting, love the fresh ingredients and farm to table here!"
Fable,"Fable was the most enchanting restaurant experience I've ever had.

We were sat at the bar but with the open
Concept kitchen, it ended up being the highlight of our night. The food was so well prepared in front of our eyes. The chefs eye for detail on the presentation was
Pristine. 

Watching the care put into each meal started my love for small business and changed my outlook on how going out for dinner should leave you feeling"
Fable,"A solid 3.5 stars. We came here for my sweetie's birthday. Fable is a farm to table restaurant that caters to a more yuppy crowd. The place was very busy, would highly recommend making resos ahead of time. We called one week in advance and let them know that it was for a birthday occasion.

We started off with the duck basket appetizer and had the ling cod and smoked duck breast as entrees.

Duck basket appetizer consists of many random parts of the duck that many people may not typically eat, such as the gizzards, neck and wings. The sauce tasted A LOT like sweet and sour pork. It was good, but not exactly what we were expecting

Ling cod was cooked well with a delicate fluffy texture, and the accompanying veggies were delicious.

Smoked duck breast was very good. The presentation and taste was appealing. But the amount of sauce was a bit overwhelming. 

Overall, we enjoyed the food but the service was average, likely due to the filled capacity of the restaurant."
Fable,"Fable has a seasonal menu (which ties in with that farm to table concept) so while my boyfriend went with their butcher's cut special, I went for their lamb and cod option. And then we decided to try their cornbread (which they offered instead of a traditional bread basket). I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised when the food arrived.

Cornbread - The best cornbread I've ever had. When I think of cornbread I think of something that's dense and possibly dry. However, this cornbread was moist and full of corn flavor. It was served with honey butter which I was tempted to just eat without any bread.

Lamb & Cod - The lamb was incredibly tender and delicious. However, I wasn't a fan of the lamb and cod combination. The two flavors and textures just didn't work together. The star of the dish for me though was the tomato stew base underneath the proteins. It was so flavorful and rich that it helped blend all the components together. And with every bite you get a punch of cumin to the face with their dukkah (a mix of herbs and spices).

In summary, this restaurant was a nice surprise. A lot of places use these key phrases like farm-to-table to try to market themselves as some kind of revolutionary one-of-a-kind restaurant. However, Fable actually stepped up the plate and delivered. I definitely recommend coming here because it's got a unique menu that has something for everyone.

Fable,"Finally had a chance to try dinner here since all I've had was the epic brunch. It was just as good, if not better!

The service was awesome as always. They must have a really stringent hiring process because everyone I've encountered working here has been really friendly and approachable. No snoody attitude here!

The food...oh the food...*dies*. 

- The corn bread was amazing. I could eat this all day, every day. They make it so well here. The paprika butter was completely unnecessary. These glorious slices of heaven were delicious without anything on it. Nom non nom nom nom. Pardon me as I make love to your gritty pillows of heaven. Did I go too far? Not nearly enough.

- The chicharrón was heavenly. I love pork rind. I usually buy a pack and give it a splash of tabasco. Here, they dusted it with tomato powder (or is it crack? I think it's crack...) and have a side dip of corn custard. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS HERE?!?! It's amazing! 

- The citrus ginger soda was delicious. It tastes almost identical to the one served at Vij's but who cares...it's refreshing, light and non-alcoholic. 

- The entrees were all delicious. Our table went silent and we heard the crickets nearby because no one was talking and all we could hear around our table were foodgasms left and right. 


SIDENOTE: I know I've thrown the word ""amazing"" around throughout this review, but it's really that good. I haven't had a bad meal here all three times. I'd happily recommend it to anyone because it's a hip, laid back, funky, and delectable place to eat. No pretentiousness, no attitude, just roll up your sleeves, kick back and relax type of place - love it. 

I should also add the price point isn't terrible. For two people including 1 alcoholic bevvie, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, it came out to $75 or so with taxes in. That's not too bad for Kits and it sure as hell is a steal when you also take into consideration the excellent service, amazing food and the nice atmosphere."
Fable,"Honestly, this is one of the best diners in town. The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star is because of the wait time and the fact they don't do reservations. We went there around brunch and had to wait around 40 minutes. When we were seated, the servers were friendly and the food was A++. If you come here, you have to try their eggs benedict. Instead of english muffins as their base, they use buttery scones so the knife slides right through them and it gives it a chewy texture. Honestly, this place has phenomenal eggs benedicts. Best I have ever had in Vancouver. It might be even better than Yolks!"
Fable,"One of those places I know I need to come back to! Abby S and I had a lunch meeting here, and I can't wait to come back just for funsies!

The staff were super friendly and seated us quickly, letting us know the specials right off the bat (and repeating the for us a few times too. 

I had their breakfast sandwich, which had tomato jam (WHAT EVEN IS THIS AND HOW CAN I CONSUME MORE), black pepper jam (see previous parentheses), egg, and a housemade sausage patty. The sausage was a tiny bit pinker than I usually like so my hypochondriac side may have freaked out a little (needlessly, I was fine, other than being SUPER FULL). The potato hash brown type this was STUPID good - I want eight hundred more of them! It's served with some kind of delicious chive cream and I am seriously craving it right now. The salad was also brilliant - well dressed and not just a heap of boring leaves - there was STUFF in it! 

Great atmosphere, great staff, terrific food. Can't wait to return!"
Fable,"I keep coming back here for brunch. And if you have a chance go to their boozy brunch on the last Sunday of every month! Half price cocktails like orange or grapefruit mimosas. Make sure to make a reservation as there can be quite a wait sometimes for brunch on weekends.

I always come back for the fable stew. Great for the usual rainy or cold mornings in Vancouver. It's more of like a soup with lardons, mushrooms and kale topped with eggs and a slice of toast. 

Also can't go wrong with the eggs Benedict. The olive oil hollandaise sauce is amazing. 

But this visit was during boozy brunch so they had some items not on the regular menu. 

Worth mentioning from that menu was the polenta with mushrooms and poached eggs topped with pickled jalapeños. Very creamy and flavourful, the pickled jalapeños were a great touch. 

Service there is always very friendly and attentive."
Fable,"They are opened Mondays and all 7 days.. I never realized how hard it is to find a lunch spot open on Mondays before.

The food is so good and fresh!  We both ordered the same dish and we both enjoy it very much!

Yarrow Meadows Duck Confit Salad ... lalala. Lalala lalala.. My heart is singing from the love for this Duck Confit, beet, goat cheese, and apple salad with crunchy granola bits.. Super Crispy Duck skin, not a sign of fatty bits anywhere, perfectly seasoned. Love the beets, I can eat a whole plateful.

Lemon Meringue Parfait is as described by Jody B. Heavenly! Who knew Tarragon Ice Cream is so good!

S'Mores.. All home made brownie, Graham crackers, Marshmellow packed into a little jar, they really need to put in a bigger jar! So decadent and good!

This restaurant does not disappoint, we were chatting with our neighbors and everyone enjoyed their meals."
Fable,"This is an overdue review. I have eaten at Fable many times, brunch, dinner, lunch, at least 7 times. My wife, son and I went for an anniversary dinner. We had a table for 3, which was actually a table for 2, OK I get it., they want to maximize seating but we were squished, it was mid week, and there were many empty tables for four, like right next to us. Our waitress had attitude, not sure what was up that night but sense of humour of zero and patience, none. We order the Halibut collar and a couple of other appetizers. The collars are amazing, second time I have had them, which is amazing as they don't have many when they have them but it is a big plate and took up 1/3 of our table, we were not even half way finished our cheeks and our other appetizer came, as did our drinks and with our waters on the table it became a challenge not to knock anything over. Oh wait what is that smell everytime one of the waiters walked by.....aftershave,  qualify this by saying maybe the stench was not coming from an employee but everytiime he walked by I smelt an overdose of aftershave so with every bite of my meal there was aftershave.  ( Fable has informed me it was more than likely not their staff as they have strict rules about wearing  aftershave, I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it was another diner). The food, awesome, all of our meals were great, the fish, the steak, no complaints there but the experience is part of the meal and it ended at 1.5  hours of our allotted 2, with the bill basically being brought to us before we could order more. This is not the Fable I know, there are a lot of choices in Vancouver, when spending 50-70/person, if not more, I can come up with several restaurants that would not sit 3 at a table for 2, would make sure their staff are in good moods, even if they are not and look at a table to see there is no room for anything else. In other words ensure the experience is as good as the food. I hope this was an anomaly but it will be a while before I find out again.

Fable management has taken the time to investigate the evening and address my concerns. The sign of a good restaurant is caring. They also encouraged me to speak up when things are going wrong and they are  right, I don't want to be a chronic complainer but if something is not right, ask, and if it can be corrected it will be. I have in the past been unhappy with a dish at other restaurants and it has been recooked, comped or I have been given another choice. Not sure why I did not speak up that evening but I didn't. I am confident that Fable cares, as a good restaurant should. and my experience was an anomaly, I will return."
Fable,"Another one I can check off the bookmark list!!  I've had Fable in my bookmark for a long time.  I wanted to come here for a special occasion, so we decided to come for my husbands birthday.  I made reservation early on a Sunday night.  We arrived at 5pm when the restaurant opened for dinner.  The inside of the restaurant is a lot smaller than I thought but super cool.  Open kitchen, some local art, and cozy atmosphere.   when we arrived we were greeted by couple of hostess greeted my husband a happy birthday (nice touch, I mentioned it on the reservation).  We were seated, the restaurant had several tables already occupied, I generally like to come for early dinners, not long after this place was packed.   Our server came by asked if we had eaten here before, we said no first time.  He recommended some appys and it was similar to what I was going to choose anyway ( recommended by other yelpers )   I also looked at the menu before coming.             1) Chickpea fitters: pickled red onions, shoots and curry mayo.  I've been dreaming of these yummy goodness since I had them last.  So good.  Like a very good falafel on steroids! That curry mayo gives it that tangy touch.  2) Canned Tuna : umm ""the best canned tuna"" they were not laying.  Where do I begin.  Its yummy albacore tuna layered with potatoes and comes with toasted crostini.  The tuna comes in a mason jar (genius!! who doesn't love that) you get to mash it all up before getting to enjoy this yummy starter, so good! 
Mains... I knew before coming here I was going to get the duck breast, and so I did.  It came with duck confit croquette, red cabbage, cranberries with some type of hollandaise sauce served on a skillet.  Very well presented.  The duck was cooked perfectly and very filling.  Both of our mains were generous portions, we did not leave hungry.   My husband had the Gnocchi and Onions with pulled pork.  We switched plates to try each others food.  The gnocchi was nice the sauce was great I thought it was better without the pulled pork, just two different taste didn't work together for me.  The pulled pork was good on its own.   
Service was great, our glasses were never empty.  It was a great experience!   I cant wait to come back and try out the brunch menu."
Fable,"We tried all the recommended appetizers (canned tuna, the chickpea fritters, the duck spaghetti). None of them really worked. They weren't bad, but they were more gimmick than substance. I had the flatiron steak on bok choy as the entree, which sous vide was perfectly cooked. I enjoyed it more than the appetizers. The highlight was the service and our toddler got toys and crayons to keep her busy which made her really happy while offering us a relaxing dinner. We were celebrating my birthday but we were too full for dessert! The portions of everything were pretty large. I'd give it 3.5 stars"
Fable,"It was a challenge not to eat the onion gnocchi with pulled pork too quickly. Food that good must be savored. 

The maple cake was described to us as a bread pudding. It was a pancake. It was good, we ate it (no regrets), but when we expect custard and then get pancake, it's a let down. 

Service was varied. One nice staffer, one fresh, and one harried and indifferent. 

Bottom line: the food tasted great. We would come back."
Fable,"I came here based on a lemon dessert review from another Yelper.

Price is between average to expensive, therefore, this is a place in which you want to save some $$$ for.

Due to the lack of respect and etiquette from some of the people in our meet up grounp with last minute cancellations, Fable were really nice and accommodating about adjusting our reservation. They made me feel less embarrassed about the lack of consideration from some in our group. Really huge shout out to them on this part.

The service was awesome and attentive. I  had chicken served by the hottest guy in the establishment. Hot guy delivering me chicken = I love you. 

Decor was basic woodsy like, dim and unpretentious. 

Lemon Meringue Parfait = Good take on the traditional pie done in a sundae cup. It looks tall, however, it is a very modest serving. A bit $$$ at $12, however, worth it. The toasted egg white was like a marshmallow. 

Mascarpone Cheesecake = A bit of a rip off for $9 for the portion size. It was well plated and tasted awesome, however, you're looking at a slice that is 1"" by .5""...really? This isn't suitable for sharing. The cake itself was well prepared and was smooth going down. 

Chickpea Fritters = 5 fritters for $9 was a decent deal. The curry mayo was unbelievable. It was tart, however, it was well paired against the chickpeas. 

Rossdown Farms Chicken = The dish was well prepared temperature and texture wise, however, I found this to be way too salty that it had any business being. Chicken was a little dry but edible. Very small portion for $24.

Overall it was a good experience and the company was awesome on an Easter Friday."
Fable,My go to farm to table restaurant. Always amazing and their service is always consistent. Love it here!
Fable,"Had a small brunch date with my friend since we were both off class.

First thing you'll probably notice walking in is the open kitchen and very warm and cosy decor. It truly gives the place a log cabin kinda feel that I love. We were promptly seated and offered drinks. One of the waiters came around soon after and asked us if we had any questions about the menu (very kind servers, by the way), and we were off to order the day special eggs benny with ling cod (as per stereotypical brunch meal). It didn't take long to come out and they were presented in a clean, simple manner with descriptions of each item. 

Now for the food: The bennies were served with a salad and a potato rosti. The salad was a bit too sour and had some mushy pieces that I left out, but I loved the crispiness of the rosti and the tang of the chive cream, albeit a bit too salty. Now, the ling cod on the bennies were a bit too fishy for us and in my preference, seemed a bit clashing with the tang of the hollandaise and the way it was prepared. However, the hollandaise was luxuriously textured and the eggs were beautifully poached. It was still a good meal nonetheless and will be back for another soon.

(Side note, ask for an extra side of milk if there's 2 of you ordering tea. My friend used all of it in his :'( )"
Fable,"What can be better than good food and great service? AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE!

We thought our luck ran out when all the tables were taken and we were offered to sit at the bar. Reluctantly I accepted because the ""bar"" is actually right in front of the kitchen. Fable is set up so that you can see the entire kitchen prepare your meal, as far as seeing them prep some of your email to the execute chef announce orders to the sous chefs. This actually came out to be a great experience because there was so much technique that you normally don't get to see. You can hear every word they are saying!

Spaghetti and Meatballs
This is not your typical spaghetti and meatballs with your marinara sauce. It comes with a white sauce, and when you first get your appetizer, it looks like a mousse or whip cream. Once you mix it and take a bite, you're mouth is having it's own little party.  You get one meatball, and it's made from DUCK. Right!? So good. 

Frites with Garlic Aioli
Basically potato wedges with aioli dipping sauce. The wedges were fried a little to long for me. I don't like my potatoes too cooked, but hey, some people do. The Garlic Aioli was delish though. However, this dish didn't do it for me. Probably won't be ordering this again.

Zucchini Tagliatelle
This dish is gross. It's spicy. The texture is completely wrong. And I can't just get over the fact that they use ZUCCHINI instead of noodles. It's weird. The waitress saw that we BARELY touched that dish and didn't charge us for it. Super nice of her and something she did not have to do. I highly recommend to stay away from this dish.

Rossdown Farms Chicken
The Barley Risotto goes AWESOME with the chicken. One huge thing that scares me about chicken is it being too dry, and this was cooked perfectly. Juicy, and it lays so nicely on the risotto. In addition, the soubise sauce just put everything together THAT much better. Great dish.

One more thing I must rave about is the service we received. Our waitress (I totally forgot her name, DARNIT) was accommodating with suggestions, removing the dish we didn't enjoy (without us asking), and even helping with directions to finding out next activity (we're from Los Angeles, traveling).

I want to come back and try a bunch of other dishes that I was debating about ordering when dining this evening. Fable is an awesome, hip place that gives you an incredible experience."
Fable,"This has become one of our standard locations when we visit Vancouver. The food is always on point. It is clear they choose good, locally sourced ingredients and they know how to bring them to the table in good form."
Fable,"Yikes! Such an awful experience!  Firstly, my husband had the eggs benedict special and was violently ill a short time after we left the restaurant!  A horrible experience to say the least. The grilled cheese was made with an oddly strange choice of cheese that had an overpowering onion flavor and did not melt properly!  People, it's a grilled cheese! The other dish we tried was the fried chicken. While the coating had lots of flavor, the meat inside was tasteless.  So disappointing! We came here because of the high yelp reviews but this was either a very bad day or they've changed cooks/management maybe?  Be warned!"
Fable,"On a recent trip to Vancouver, I came to Fable for dinner and it was one of my favourite meals of the trip. I wanted to go on a Friday night for an anniversary dinner, so I made a reservation in advance. I'm glad I did because when we got there at 7:30 the place was packed.

We started with the chickpea fritters, which everyone seems to recommend on yelp. When the fritters hit the table, the spices immediately hit us as they were so fragrant. Considering there was 5 fritters it was a good plate to share, and they were very flavourful. At a reasonable 9 dollars, you should consider ordering it.

For our mains, I got the duck breast, with perogies, creamed cabbage and preserved berries. The duck skin was seared perfectly, while leaving the breast fairly pink, although way to pink for someone like my mom. The creamed cabbage was super yummy, and the perogies were big and made in house. The preserved berries added a sweetness to the plate, which I quite enjoyed. My girlfriend got the gnocchi with the pulled pork option, and she still says it's one of the best things she has ever eaten. I luckily got to finish it off, and the texture of the gnocchi was very soft and pillowy. Absolutely perfect.

For dessert we got the s'mores and we were not disappointed. It was a very pretty presentation, just like the rest of the food. But the milk chocolate ice cream inside of it was a nice twist on a s'mores. It was a really good size, and all of the desserts I saw were a perfect size for sharing.

Overall, I found the prices extremely fair for the quality and portions of the food. This is a place that does it right. I'm a big Top Chef fan, and watched the season Trevor and his other Top Chef compatriots who work at the restaurant were on. I've been to Richmond Station, Carl's restaurant, a couple times, and I find the food at Fable is more creative, and just as excellent. Would recommend it to people visiting the city as a place to go for a nice dinner."
Fable,"I love this place. 4th time here. We are from Seattle and every time we visit Vancouver, we come to fable. 

Our faves are the French toast and the salmon bennies. 

Awesome!"
Fable,Great service and ambiance. Came at 7:45pm on a Sunday and there were a few tables available. The table for two is quite small though. The gnocchi was sold out so I ordered the tomato bisque (good comfort food) and the mussels. The mussels- especially the sauce were amazing! My husband got the butchers cut meal which was a stiletto steak. He also enjoyed it - the meat was so tender.
Fable,"Really casual environment. Everyone is so laid-back and friendly and the food is actually affordable!

Loved the ""spaghetti and meatballs"" which is interpretation of the classic with duck meatballs, a light creamy sauce, and tagliatelle. Perfect for sharing between 2-3 people as an appetizer.

The onion gnocchi was to die for. Clouds of fluffy potato onion pillows that appeared to be lightly panfried. But save room for the s'mores as that's where all the magic happens.

Toasted marshmallow fluff on top of chunks of chocolate cookie and chocolate mousse and cookie bits, you can't leave without ordering it!"
Fable,Fable offers an incredible menu that every foodie will drool over. The onion gnocchi was a favourite. Perfect place to go a for a casual date night and just enjoy each other's company while partaking in fantastic food. A must try in Vancouver!
Fable,The number one rated restaurant in Vancouver on Yelp and man did it come through!  The best beet salad ever!!  If you're in the NW make a trip out to this North West jem
Fable,"This is a great restaurant!! Love the open kitchen where you see chefs busy preparing the yummies in front of you!
Came here on a Sun morning without reservation at 11am and waited 30 min to get a table for 3.
We ordered the scramble egg, the french toast and pulled pork Johnny cake. 
I love the scramble egg which was served in a jar topped with parmesan foam. The eggs were done perfectly so you can still taste pieces of it but also a bit creamy, not mushy. 
The French Toast was made from rich brioche with seasonal preserve (I forgot what ours was but it was tasty).
The Pulled Pork Johnny Cake was very special. There were two layers of fluffy pancake with pulled pork and spicy pickled jalapeño and drizzled maple syrup. The saltiness and sweetness all blended very well together with a hint of spice. Love it!!  
Food tasted very fresh and I love the fact that they are sourced locally!!"
Fable,"This is a great restaurant I choose for special events, the most recent being a birthday dinner.  We ordered several dishes.  The spaghetti and duck meatball was outstanding.  The chickpea fritters and stiletto steak were very good.  The halibut was good, but I didn't love the stinging nettle oat risotto.  I wouldn't order it again.  The s'mores dessert was fantastic.  The service was excellent and we had a friendly and genuine, down to earth server.  I like that the restaurant keeps some solid faves on the menu and then changes up seasonally.  There's always something new to try.  We'll be back for our next special event!"
Fable,"I tried Fable because of all the great reviews. The restaurant itself is very nice inside, not very large but decorated well, a nice open kitchen if you choose to sit at the bar you can watch your food being prepared, I love that! I had the Tomato Soup & the Chickpea Fritters as my appetizers both were presented very nice and tasted great. I had the Salmon for my main course, I personally wasn't that impressed with it, it was a little under cooked for my liking and I wasn't a big fan of the beet puree. I do however love the farm to table aspect of the restaurant. If I try another main course and love it like the appetizers I may update my review and give it 5 stars!"
Fable,"The last time I was here, I was deciding between the ling cod and gnocchi when the owner/manager (not sure) walked by and said to get the gnocchi, ""it's life changing."" And let me tell you, the gnocchi was life changing! Perfect pillowy pieces of heaven!

I never had a bad meal or less-than-phenomenal service at Fable, and I truly think coming here is a wonderful experience. I chose Fable for my family birthday dinner last year and my family *still* raves about their meals, and compares other eateries to here."
Fable,"We were only staying in Vancouver for a few days but had to come back to this place a second time it was so good, and it was actually a little out of the way for us. Everything we had was delicious, from the ""canned"" tuna, the chickpea fritters, the grilled cheese with pulled pork, the soups, the burger, the eggs benedict, and a delicous Tagliatelle pasta.

The service was very helpful and friendly and it had a nice decor. Everything looked and tasted fresh and healthy. They are a ""farm to table"" sort of restaurant. Portions are decent and prices are reasonable. I will definitely venture back here the next time I'm in Vancouver."
Fable,"The service was excellent, and the food was amazing. We had the eggs Benedict and the steak sandwich, and both were delicious."
Fable,Visiting Vancouver with friends. Tried slow cooked salmon and mussels. Give it max stars rating! Great experience being first time tried out Canadian food!
Fable,Fabulous food. Super creative menu along with great service is a magic combination. Try this out now!
Fable,"Duck meatballs and fritters,
Stiletto calf meat and mushrooms,
Exciting salmon and cracklicious potatoes, 
Lemon meringue and old fashioned syrup cake.

Excellent service. Our waitress was 5-stars on food recommendations, wine recommendations, humor, attentiveness, and being a human being. Top 10 waitresses we've ever had the pleasure of being taken care of by.

Time to slee...zzzz"
Fable,"We went here for a Sunday evening dinner. To our surprise it was extremely busy. We found parking right in front, and was able to get a table for two rather quickly. 

The location is small and reminds me of restaurants in New York. The server was really friendly and attentive to us. 

They did run out of the Gnocchi, which was what we came for originally. We got the tomato bisque as a starter to me it tasted like a spaghetti sauce to me but with the grill cheese was perfect.

I got the Stiletto Steak that was cooked for 48hrs. It was great didn't even need my knife as the meat was so tender it came right apart but stayed together. The choice of vegetables I would of went a different direction. The meat was great but the vegetables didn't complete it for me. I only wish I had more then 3 mushrooms underneath. The Black Jam was great as well a little kick for me but good. All in all I give Fabble 4 stars."
Fable,Sure it's likely fresh and locally sourced...but I think the taste fell short. It's also quite expensive relative to the other restaurants we visited.
Fable,"So happy we discovered this little spot while in Vancouver! I was happy with every aspect of dinner. We had a terrific and knowledgeable server, great cocktails, tried the ""canned tuna"" appetizer (so delicious) and a gorgeous dinner. Definitely a 5 in my book."
Fable,"Fable is absolutely amazing!  I've been here almost 5 times and it just keeps getting better.  Their canned tuna is the signature dish - my girlfriend and I orders it EVERY time.  Comes in a glass jar, where you'll mix the tuna with a ton of good tasting mix and you have it on crostini.  Order more crostini for free cause there's a ton of tuna :)

Their duck meatball with pasta is delicious.  You can really taste the duck flavor and it's pretty special.  For the entree, there's a board in the back of the room with daily specials.  Check that out before the menu, it's always something different.  One time we had a pork special for about 60 bucks, and they served a ton of pork cooked in many ways.  It was so good!

Make sure to ask their servers for recommendations because all of then are awesome!  They'll take their time and figure out the perfect combos for you.  In fact, I mostly just ask them to recommend almost all of our food ;)"
Fable,"We were visiting from out of town and had a celebratory dinner at Fable. My boyfriend found this place and we were so happy we got to experience such a wonderful evening at Fable.   The food is wonderful (words just sell it short really) but what is so neat is the love that goes into each plate that is made.  We had the opportunity to sit at the bar and watch the each plate be made.  It was so cool to watch each of the masters work their magic with such ease, joy, and attentiveness.  We will definitely be back as well as sharing this dining experience with our friends.  

A special thank you to our server, Daniel.  He was the nicest and was genuinely interested in creating a dynamic atmosphere.  We really enjoyed talking to him and learning more about teh restaurant and Vancouver.

THANK YOU, Fable!!!!"
Fable,Very tasty eggs Benedict. The ham was obviously cooked in house. I enjoyed how it was thinly shaved.
Fable,Really good brunch food! Enjoyed the fresh scrambled eggs and omlet with mimosas for a nice brunch with my friend. Very good service and got our food pretty quickly. Would definitely recommend!
Fable,"Made it just after the lunch rush so the service was very fast and friendly.  I had the Ploughman's lunch platter, the salad was very fresh and light which contrasted well with the sausage patty and soup.  The cream of tomato soup was the highlight of the platter, rich and creamy, it was delicious.  However the pickled vegetables did feel a little out of place.  Also the lemon meringue parfait and smores were a great way to finish the meal.  The LM parfait was a tad sweet, but the London fog ice cream was quite smooth.  The  smores was decadent and was delicious."
Fable,"Updated Review

This is my second visit to Fable. My first visit was not great, but I had wanted to be back and finally got the chance today. I have to say I am very glad I returned. I was completely bowled over by the food. I had onion gnocchi and my husband had halibut in some kind of tomato sauce. I thought they were both delicious and portions were generous. The gnocchi was my favourite. In terms of presentation and the way the complicated flavours came together, it was very well done. My husband thought the sauce for the halibut dish was a bit too strong, but I loved it and he agreed that overall it was very good. The canned tuna starter was very tasty as well. Overall, a great experience which got even better when we ordered the smores dessert! We had plans to go to rain or shine for icecream afterwards but we saw the table next to us order it and decided to go for it.  We did not regret our choice! The server was a bit pushy and asked my husband if he was done thrice. We also got the wrong check the first time but she was quick to correct that. The food wins! I am a fan and I hope to return to try other things on their menu!


Older Review (2 STARS)

Okay. So I can see this place has great reviews, but my experience did not match. We stumbled upon this place after getting some ice cream at rain and shine, next door and decided to make a quick dinner stop because a friend had raved about it. Luckily, they had a table for two and we were quickly seated. 

Our server took time to explain the specials to us and listed the prices as well, but it came off a bit as a rehearsed script as we tried to tell him we do not eat red meat, but he continued, which wasn't too bad just a bit textbook. I had a glass of red wine and he brought me some to taste before I confirmed the order. Very nice! I ordered the roasted duck breast. I requested it to be well done as it is a matter of preference but the server told me it is already smoked so better to be medium rare and insisted on it. I accepted it reluctantly. The dish was okay, but I would have preferred it well done and I wish I had insisted back. The quinoa and nuts bed it came on was on the sweeter side and felt a bit like breakfast cereal. My husband had the salmon collar tacos, which was a special appetizer but the server told us it was a shared plate and could be a main. My husband went for it because he was intrigued by its novelty. Unfortunately, it is a bit strange to make tacos with lettuce leaves. He felt if you call it tacos maybe tortillas would be a better accompaniment. Overall not impressed by the food.

However, after scanning through the reviews here I feel we ordered the wrong stuff. I would have tried the dessert had we not had ice cream before. I would visit again if I am in the vicinity or for brunch because I liked the ambience and some of their menu options look interesting. As a concept farm to table is also a great idea."
Fable,"I read all these phenomenal reviews and boy was I excited to check this place out. I went for lunch, which is the only reason I will try this place one more time for dinner, because the lunch menu was tiny. 

Goodness:
The decor- very nice, rustic, but clean and not pubby. 

The service- the server was attentive and polite. They made an error with my order and promptly resolved it and then took the plate off my bill. I was happy. 

Badness:
The food- I took the first bite and thought, this is oily and salty but delicious... half way through the meal my gallbladder and liver were seizing up. I wiped the sweat off my brow and glanced with blurred vision for an AED incase someone has a heart attack. 
Seriously though, there were six people at our table and the unanimous opinion was that the food was too salty and greasy. 

And really that's the only issue... but I'm going there for the food, so if it's not up to par, then I'm left sitting on an uncushioned chair thinking of the master cleanse I'm going to start the following day."
Fable,"The food was decent and I love the farm to table concept. The waiter was also French and hilarious.
We stood in line for maybe 30 minutes before getting a spot- it's definitely a Vancouver favourite.


However, the portions were soooo small. We had to order multiple entrees before we were full. We probably wouldn't choose this as a go-to; more of an experience that you know will be stable and decent. No socks were blown off!"
Fable,Vegan friendly - however there was only one main course dish on the menu that could be made vegan. The server very kindly took care of my orders and told me they could switch out certain things to make a non-vegan dish vegan. The beet root tartar was delicious as well as the zucchini tagliatelle. Everything was great except they were a little too salty in my opinion... Since I do eat a whole foods plant based low salt and oil diet it could just be my personal acquired taste though. However my family who are not vegan also found it too salty. Great service though!
Fable,Went there early and it wasn't too busy.     Had the canned tuna and it was only ok.  Everyone said it was so awesome but I didn't think too much of it.   Had a duck breast dish which was delish.  The steak meal was average.   Ok prices.  Not crazy expensive but not cheap either.
Fable,"This was my third time to Fable and they've all been for brunch. My main critique was that the portion sizes were not that big. This time, we had to wait around for my parents to show up so my wife and I silently watched the line prepare every item on the menu. After watching everything be made with such care and quality ingredients, I couldn't wait to order. Got the ham benny (as usual) and was super impressed. The eggs were cooked perfectly, hollandaise had the perfect consistency and the ham was awesome (thinly sliced and piled as opposed to a thick slab). 

Coffee was an excellent roast (I had 4) and the banana bread was amongst the best i've ever had. We were told they only bake a batch once per month so we lucked out.

It's funny... this is one of those places that I'm glad I never reviewed because it only got better each time I went."
Fable,"I did a lot of research before my recent trip to Vancouver and narrowed down dinner on my first night to Fable and Tableau Bar Bistro. The woman at my hotel's front desk convinced me to go with Fable. Coming from San Francisco, I was interested to see how the food would be at a Top Chef Canada restaurant. Overall, I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service was excellent -- the waitress was both friendly, helpful and attentive.

I started with the Heirloom tomato salad with ricotta, cucumber, and a honey thyme vinegarette. the highlight was the cheese, and the dish had the most flavor of everything I ordered. Next I had the Slow cooked salmon with a carrot puree and summer cassoulet, and I have to say that it was pretty bland and flavorless and I was not wild about the consistency of the salmon. I was tempted to have the Lemon Meringue Parfait based on reviews on this site, but I was looking for something that was not overly sweet. The waitress recommended the Blueberry lavender tart, and the kitchen was great and substituted the tarragon ice cream for the buttermilk ice cream. It was ok, but did not have a lot of flavor. 

I sampled a couple of red wines, and ended up trying two different B.C. reds both of which were excellent. The entire meal cost a little over $90, including tip, which I felt was on the high side relative to the quality of the food. Perhaps living in San Francisco I have really high expectations, but I would not return given the option."
Fable,"My friend and I were not disappointed in our choice tonight for dinner .   We decided last minute to dine at Fable.   I called ahead to assess the chance of getting a table at 8pm.  The hostess on the phone was nice enough to say it's busy but had room at the bar now and a table will come available in 20 mins.

So we decided to try for either options.   Luckily the bar spots were still available when we got there.  We truly enjoyed our spot at the bar by the serving station.   Not too sure if I would like being in the seats by the door though, too many people standing behind you waiting for their seats.

Anyhow we enjoyed watching the chef expediting the orders and not being crowded by other diners around us. 

We started off with the canned tuna as recommended by other reviewers.  We truly enjoyed it.   Be warned its a small portion.  Great if you aren't sharing.  I suggest not sharing cause its that good.  My friend had the gnocchi with pulled pork and I had the duck.   Both a great choice.   I encouraged my friend who doesn't like  duck to try my duck.  She was pleasantly surprised how lean it was.   They've done a great job at trimming away the fat and left a tasty medium rare meat on the plate. 

My friend's gnocchi was hearty and full of flavour, she was stuffed and had to take the rest home.   With a bottle and half of litre of wine with our meal we were stuffed and unfortunately didn't have room for dessert,  even though what we saw liked delicious. 

The service was attentive,  not at all pretentious as one reviewers also noted.   The atmosphere was relax and I also noticed other diners taking the time to thank the staff for a great meal. 

Fable is a definite must try"
Fable,"My go to restaurant.  I know that I'm going to get great quality food and fantastic service.  It's not your high end dining where you encounter pretentious guests who only know food by the price beside it.  

It's busy, tables are close but I can't justify a better bang for the buck.  Gnocchi and the duck are my go to for dinner.  Can't say enough even after 3 years."
Fable,"Oh, be still my local loving, beating heart. I am home. 

In this order, shared with your dinner date:

1st course:
Canned Tuna
Rabbit Pate 

2nd course:
Pork Belly P's Gnocchi 
Duck Breast

Dessert:
Lemon Meringue Parfait
Rhubarb Textures

Many others have given away the secrets of the canned tuna and lemon meringue, so I won't linger. Instead, I'll suggest you reserve 2 stools at the far end of the first bar and that you come with an appetite, a sense of culinary curiosity, and a smile for the chefs who you'll be engaging with (if you'd like) during your whole experience."
Fable,"Amazing dinner spot for between $30 - $50 per person. Wonderful service and delicious, fresh, fusion dishes. For two people, we had the following tonight:

Rustic bread with brown butter ($4) - really fresh bread with unique butter!

Best canned tuna ($12) - it's a small cup of tuna, potato, and some sauces that you mash together to make a paste (eat it like a bruschetta). May be a little bit overrated but we still liked it as a small appetizer.

Duck Breast ($24) - cooked to medium rare perfection. Very tender and juicy meat balanced by the sweet quinoa mix underneath.

Pork loin sausage ($25) - just as good as the other entree and very suited for the meat lover. The blueberry sauce it comes with is just the perfect compliment to the pork loin, bacon, and ""cole slaw"" like base.

S'mores dessert ($10) - Marshmallow meringue, chocolate ice cream, brownie, and caramel chunks layered goodness. Not the most healthy option but a sweet way to end an enjoyable meal.

The restaurant is not very big but perfect for a date or an intimate family meal. We will definitely come again soon!"
Fable,"One of the best meals I've had in a long time, this place is nw cuisine at its best. They have special bread everyday which is amazing and unique and really everything is. Chickpea fritters were light with an amazing curry sauce, the sausage wrapped pork had their own Korean BBQ sauce and kimchi and was lovely as well.  Order one of their signature cocktails as well.

Oh and not to mention the service is also great. I'll come back here every time I return to Vancouver."
Fable,"I am a regular here, and I usually think the food is great, but the staff is horrible. They treat all their clients as children. The vibe is that the older staff members can't catch up with their younger, more successful clients so they treat them like shit. I mean, young lawyers, business professionals, and doctors go here from the nearby professional towers. It is JUST like the staff screwed up in life and can't handle that their clients are younger, far more successful than they are and smarter than they are. Just bring me my coffee and don't tell me some sad story about how you were 18 and you never went to college and had your baby at 16."
Fable,"The food here is awesome! The host was very cheery and welcoming and our service throughout our meal was impeccable. I ordered the pulled pork johnny cakes. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants sweet and savory for their breakfast. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and the steak was perfectly cooked. My mom initially sat in a syrup-stained seat and the staff offered her a new seat immediately as well as offered her help with her dry cleaning if she wanted. Overall, a small bumpy start to our meal that was very quickly resolved and followed by an awesome meal. 10/10 would come back here for the food and especially the service!"
Fable,"What a lovely, yummy lunch. We had the pasta of the day, which was absolutely delicious. All of the flavors were perfectly balanced. The beet salad was divine."
Fable,"Nice place for brunch and dinner. Fresh ingredients delicately cooked but with reasonable price tags. 

Very friendly staff and great ambience every time."
Fable,"No visit to Vancouver is complete without a visit to Fable. It's one of those places that's a mix between casual and upscale dining. The food is fantastic, the plates are easy to share and it's got some of the happiest and friendliest staff you'll find!

The space is great for smaller parties of 2-4 people.

Items I've enjoyed:
- the canned tuna. It doesn't sound like the most appetizing dish, but trust me, you want to try this! It comes in its own jar, served with some pieces of baguette to dish it onto. 
- flat bread. Topped with kale, bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions. So good.
- chickpea fritters. Served with pickled red onion, shoots and curry mayo. You must have a bit of that curry mayo... it makes the fritter!
- lemon meringue parfait. It's a highlight, blowtorch used on top! 

If you get a chance, snag a spot at the wood so you can see the kitchen in action. You'll remember I said they're a friendly bunch... 

Otherwise, I recommend a reservation. It's not often there's space for walk ins. 

Oh, and I'm told the last Sunday of every month is boozy brunch. One of these days I'll make sure I'm in town for one of those!

Thanks for being awesome Fable!"
Fable,"Delicious and intricate dishes in a relaxing atmosphere! We had the chickpea fritters and they were so unique and flavourful. And the duck meatball and spaghetti, what presentation! Small portion for that but very delicious. The veg on our steak dish had a wonderful flavour and great cook on them, but the sous-vide steak was not as good as the other dishes. The decor was pleasant, as were the staff and atmosphere. Definitely will come back!"
Fable,"I had an ok/nice meal but thankfully I didn't have to pay! We shared the 5th least expensive bottle of red wine, one appy and a main each and our total before tip was $155.  Bread is not provided, you pay extra and our slices were less than 1"" high, 5/8"" thick and 3"" long (similar in shape and size to a fingerling potato), that part was probably the most egregious for me."
Fable,"Loved every aspect of dining at Fable, from the service (friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful wait staff) to the ambiance, to the food. I had the tomato soup as a first course, which came with mini-grilled cheese sandwiches in the center of the bowl--I'm not normally a creamy soup fan, but in combination with the sandwiches and warm bread/buns for dipping, it was great.

The highlight was the entree, Gnocchi + Onion with Pulled Pork. This was one of the best dishes I've ever had! It was an interesting mixture of flavors and everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My girlfriend had the salmon, which was great in its own right, but she couldn't stop picking gnocchi off my plate.

For dessert, we had ""Oops, I dropped the dessert"" - an upside-down waffle cone simulating an unfortunate ice cream accident. We were hoping for more rhubarb (since it was featured in the description), but it focused on blueberry ice cream and relegated the rhubarb to a paste on the side. Still, it didn't disappoint and finished off an amazing meal for us.

Highly recommend Fable to anyone looking for creative dishes in an upscale (but not stuffy) environment."
Fable,"I got the salmon eggs Benedict special and friend got the farmer's market (?). Mine had goat cheese, cooked salmon, eggs and hollandaise. Watching them make the food from their open kitchen is really fun, they squeeze (their very awesome) hollandaise out of a whipped cream canister. The salmon portion was very generous and the egg was poached very soft and wonderfully. Their hashbrown with sour cream is incredible, and they also have leafy greens + vinaigrette to complete the meal. The service was attentive and the ambience was wonderful. One problem with the bar is that the legroom is incredibly minimal, a bit uncomfortable for long legs. Would definitely come back!"
Fable,"Highly recommended.
Great and friendly service.
Food is amazing.
We've tried almost everything on their menu and everything is fantastic."
Fable,"The food in Fable is amazing you would love anything they have. This was my first time at BC. I am glad I got to experience their dishes. Make sure you book a reservation,  it can get very busy. Their dishes are very flavourful and different from any typical dishes. I really recommend this restaurant,  would not regret it."
Fable,"I have had two meals that I truly consider the ""best meals/dining experiences of my life (so far)"" and my dinner at Fable last week is for sure one of them.* It is that good.

My friend and I showed up for dinner around 6pm without a reservation, but we still got a table within half an hour. However, I'd recommend making a reservation, especially if you have more than two people in your party, because from what we could tell, this place gets really busy. They also don't do a wait list, so to keep your place in the waiting-for-a-table queue, you should just stick around. The hostess was very nice about it all, though, even though there was a nonstop stream of reservationless people coming in at all times and crowding the front of the restaurant.

Our server Claude was enthusiastic and hilarious -- he was so friendly and made the entire experience all the more awesome. But THE FOOD is the real star here. We ordered the cornbread because being from the Southern United States, I am a big fan of cornbread. This one did not disappoint. It comes in four wedges and is lightly toasted and served with the most insanely tasty honey butter. Do yourself a favor and ORDER THE CORNBREAD IF IT'S ON THE MENU.

I got one of the pasta specials with sea beans, broccolini, and pickled morels. The pickled morels were a little much and I ended up kind of shoving them to one side, but the rest was delicious. I ate it in a very quick and unflattering way and I don't care. My friend got the gnocchi with pesto, and though she really enjoyed it, I'll warn you that the gnocchi isn't your traditional kind. These were huge, pillowy gnocchi that resembled the giant marshmallows you toast over a campfire for s'mores. But that said, it was still so good (I may have snuck a bite or 4, what of it???).

Do not skip dessert. Get the lemon meringue dessert or the s'mores one, or get both if you're a true winner. I don't normally like puddings and custards and whatnot but these were so decadent and delicious that my friend and I polished them off with no trouble at all. I've never had meringue that was this soft and toasty. How do they do it!? (witchcraft, probably.)

*in case you're wondering, the other one was at Shiro's in Seattle"
Fable,"Two words: pork platter.  Incredible food and knowledgeable, attentive service!  Really liked that the servers listened to what we were saying and responded to our questions, then politely offered other choices when appropriate.  I think some people just want to show off to their companions and have their egos stroked by servers, and that isn't remotely their function.  It's unfortunate that some reviewers seem to have had that experience, but after 4 visits over two years I am very surprised to hear that about Fable, because that has never been my experience here.  Don't listen!  You HAVE to try this place!  I can't think of any other Vancouver restaurant that focuses on farm to table with this level of food and service for these prices AND isn't remotely pretentious.  Really, really excellent value!  They also take reservations, but not for prime times (like 6-8pm-ish Fri and Sat), so they can also accommodate walk-ins - in other words, a variety of patrons.  Nice!  Go to Fable...  the power of the Yelp compels you..."
Fable,We love it here. It's always delicious. They do a great job of accommodating my food allergies. Service is always friendly and professional. Excellent place to eat any day of the week.
Fable,"Probably my favorite restaurant in the last couple years! A must do, when in Vancouver. Very unique, very delicious combinations of flavors. The drinks are great, too! Try the ""tuna in a can"". Never disappoints."
Fable,"Meh. Great service. Good cocktails. 

Mains were fairly well-executed and not super overpriced. Smoked duck was well-cooked though some crispy skin would have been nice. 

Squash salad was under-seasoned. 

Duck meatball was dry. 

Good meal but I wouldn't rush back."
Fable,This place is so beautiful and calming. I love the atmosphere. The organic food. The good service. Very wholesome and delicious all around. I come here so often. Everything on the menu is delicious. You will not regret giving it a try. Maybe I'll see you there!
Fable,"I had heard good things about Fable and finally went for dinner one night with a small group of friends. Most of us were underwhelmed with our food, if not outright disappointed.

Service: Decent. Hostess and waitresses were friendly enough to accommodate a special drink order, but after being initially pleased that they offered to check our coats, we found out that they merely hung our stuff all over the restaurant on random hooks and ladders on the walls. If I had any valuables or an expensive coat, I would've been alarmed since anyone could easily snatch it on their way out the door. Some of our jackets weren't even hung near our table at all.

Food: Such a let down! I see from the many rave reviews that brunch seems to be the more popular dining option at Fable, but we had dinner. I started with the generously sized octopus salad, but the octopus was chewy as hell, the sauce/dressing was nearly as nonexistent as the romanesco billed on the menu. I also had the mussels. I ove mussels, but I couldn't even finish the dish. How do you screw up mussels? Thank goodness I didn't order fries to accompany it, because the sauce had zero flavour. About half a dozen mussels weren't even open, which rendered them inedible. And the grilled bread that came with it was so charred, I could smell how burnt it was. Three of my friends also couldn't finish any of their plates. The duck was apparently too tough to eat. At these prices, serving some pretty basic comfort food shouldn't be this much of a miss. And a small bit of bread with butter shouldn't be an extra charge.

Ambience: Cozy, but loud. It might be too cramped if you had a large group of people."
Fable,"Service and experience was well above its price range. The first courses tasted great but the main courses seemed like they were trying too hard, and didn't live up to the expectations. However, the desserts were great, which was a wonderful finish."
Fable,"Came here for Sunday brunch. It fills up fast! 
They open at 10:30 and are full by 11:00
We arrived at 10:30, group of 4 and were seated right away

Service
- excellent, our coffee was always filled
- parties are not seated until all are present
- the staff were very nice, genuine, friendly

Decor
- cozy, clean, modern
- clean washrooms

Food
I had the omelette:
- came with side of roasted potatoes - perfectly warm and soft inside, crispy on the outside
- the omelette itself was a little greasy, it was in a puddle of oil, but that might have been from the melted cheese - if you like greasy then this is perfect
- loved the chunky crispy thick cut bacon on top
- rustic bread was toasted perfectly

Friends ordered:
Kale with pulled pork (daily special) - really tender pork, good portion of meat
Scrambled egg - I didn't try this but it came in a mason jar, was told it was good

Sunday drink menu (LAST SUNDAY OF THE MONTH ONLY)
- this is what we really came for, the drinks are very very affordable and delicious
- Slutty farmhen 3$~ - fruity shot with jager and other juices
- Mimosa 4$~ - choice of grapefruit or orange. I had grapefruit- you can actually taste the alcohol in this one, some places don't put enough and it just tastes like juice, not here!
- Draft beers for ~4$ - The Gypsy Tears from parallel 49 was quite good, - Hoppy but not too bitter - good if you like hops!

Id come back, brunch entrees for 12-17$ that actually taste fresh and good have good portions. Fairly priced drinks. Im a fan"
Fable,"Oh no, I was really hoping to enjoy Fable as the concept is really up my alley but my mum and I were both disappointed! 

To start with, our servers were absolutely delightful and they seemed to be very knowledgeable about the menu. My mum had the duck breast and enjoyed the flavours but not how there was a sort of tendon (?) running through each piece of meat and was difficult to eat. She also found the brussels sprouts to have been charred a little too far.

I went for the potato crusted chicken which was plated beautifully, although it really tasted like a semi-glorified tater tot, but sadly underseasoned. I was surprised that the breast meat was used because it doesn't offer too much flavour, which added further to its blandness. As a place that served pig trotters as a daily special, I didn't expect for Fable to use a very boring part of a chicken! I ended up taking most of my meal home, and the next day added some sea salt and dijon mustard which added a little more flavour.

That being said, when a friend took me here for a birthday over a year ago, we had a pretty decent lunch. Although you can't really go wrong with grilled cheese sandwiches and salad : ) I would love to come here again and try something else! Hopefully we just had an off night."
Fable,"It's really hard for me to do Fable justice with a 5-star rating and review as everyone for the most part has called it simply ""amazing""- and they're right.

Food, service, atmosphere, it's all amazing. So, I'm going to try to do my best here, so bear with me!

The TLDR (Too long, didn't read) version;

1). Fable treats their customers like family. If you go more than once, they remember you. Not just the front staff, but the kitchen as well.
2). Don't know what to order? Ask your server. The second time I was at Fable, our server guided us through the menu to completion... awesome suggestions and you could tell, she loved her job.
3). The food is tasty. You can't go wrong, seriously. 
4). It warrants repeating: The service is phenomenal. 


The first time I ventured to Fable was with a group of friends and family for their ""Chef Tasting Menu"" which was at the bar, overseeing the kitchen. What an experience! You got to interact with the staff, see them sweat (not on the food, I swear!) and just watch a well-oiled machine work it's magic.

We were taken through the menu on what can only be described as a culinary adventure.

The Food:

First, it was recommended we start of with an Oyster paired with Bowmore 15. I was assured it would be life-changing... and it was. From then on, the dinner only got better.

I'll spare you the details on the individual dishes as there are tons of reviews that will do them better justice than I can (except for that one review who said it was salty... he must be insane).

- Roast Beet Salad; delicious way to start the meal.
- Chickpea Fritters; just order them and thank me later.
- Canned Tuna; the hype lives up to it, but truthfully, my stomach chooses Fritters over Tuna.

- Rabbit Pot Pies (That day's special); this needs to be a staple at Fable, and I'm tempted to move my review down a star just to make it clear how serious I am. It was an absolutely pleasure watching them make the Pot Pie from scratch though, well done everyone!

- Mascarpone Cheesecake; my favorite. Light and a delicious way to end the meal.
- Parfait; A heavy hitter. Rich, creamy, delicious.

The Wine:

We opted to have the Sommelier pair our dishes with a 3 oz pour. This and the Oyster/Bowmore pairing was the best decision we made.

The wine was explained to us in a friendly and what can only be described as an exciting manner. We were actually eager to try the wine and discuss the notes amongst ourselves (yea, some of us are wine nerds).
However, it's all in the details! 
Our sommelier explained the pairing twice to us, at either end of the table. This way, no one missed out and everyone was included. 

The Service:

I can't stress this enough: Fable has some of the best service in town. It's relaxed, happy and friendly and they care. It really just comes down to that- they really do care that your meal goes perfectly.

I'll be back, no doubt about it."
Fable,"One of the best dining experiences. Why? The restaurant puts in great care of their ingredients and serving to make sure you as a diner are happy. We were lucky to have Ben as our server extraordinaire. He's very knowledgable about wines, cocktails, food, where it's all sourced. Any questions were answered with detail and grace. Everything we ordered was outstanding. Really great decor, very comfortable and high quality overall. Not overpriced. Highly recommend this place for dinner. Mega impressed."
Fable,"Where do I start?  We entered a very cozy and was greeted by a very friendly lady. She ended up being our server, Lisa. We asked her for a few recommendations and she was very knowledgeable about all the food they served. The way she described it made me fall in love with it already. We started out with the corn bread-that was average, nothing special at all. Next were the Chickpea Fritters- the Fritters by itself were nothing special but the way they combined the sauce, vegetables  with it was excellent. We ordered the Spaghetti Meatball appetizer - it was so divine we had to order another order. Salmon- it was prepared to perfection.  Extremely fresh and tasty, loved the tomatoes chutney. Hanger Steak - it was grilled perfectly. The reduced sauce is indescribably yummy. The gnocchi with bacon - like no others I've tasted. I could not find one bad thing on the menu. We might be coming back tomorrow. The only thing I can think of for them to improve is when a person is coming there to celebrate their birthday, they should send out a complimentary dessert or at least say Happy Birthday at the end of the meal."
Fable,"I went to Fable last week with an old friend, and the canned tuna definitely stood out to me, as I had read before on here! Pricy but worth it for the ""F-able"" Experience We had a brunette server and she was very pleasant. Will be back again! Thank you"
Fable,"The egg in the benny is not runny, disappointed. The atmosphere and service are good, therefore 3 stars."
Fable,"Had the starter salad, canned tuna, then moved on to salmon and pork wrapped in duck, then finished with smore. Top 3 best meals at a restaurant and fairly priced. Enjoy!"
Fable,"After countless 5 star reviews and recommendations from my foodie friends, I had high expectations for Fable. I had reservations for a Sunday evening dinner and WOW, did it live up to all the glory! 

**5 stars for Creativity**
Potato Crusted Chicken, Chickpea fritters and Canned Tuna - just a few items on the menu that highlighted the talent and creativity of (previous Top Chef Canada contestant) Trevor Bird.The concept of Fable (Farm to Table = Fable) should make every Canadian proud that FINALLY, a talented chef has opened a restaurant that helps define Canadian cuisine in a fun and non-pretentious way! 

**5 stars for Quality**
Unbelievably fresh EVERYTHING. Local ingredients arrive every day and the team puts in their labour of love, preparing everything from scratch for dinner service. It is apparent they stand by their name and concept. 

**5 stars for the Food**
Canned Tuna - our server recommended this dish for us and as a fan of ""normal"" canned tuna, I was curious about how this place would redefine the aluminum can version you buy at the grocery store. The tuna arrived in a cute little mason jar with huge chunks of tuna, potato and delicious, zesty sauce. To go alongside the tuna, we had warm, fresh crostini - the perfect pairing! I will always remember Fable fondly when I open a can of tuna to make my sandwiches (and long for their version).

Potato Crusted Chicken - the chicken was cooked to perfection and wrapped with mashed potatoes, finished with a crusty coating. As a lover of chicken, this out-of-the box dish really elevated my idea of fried chicken. The chicken was not the only star of this dish - the heirloom carrots were buttery and as fresh as a Spring morning and the crispy onions complimented the dish perfectly. I even finished every last drop of the soubise sauce!

Steak Frites - I cannot count the amount of times I've ordered this dish at restaurants around the world, but I CAN count the ONE time I will finally write a review about it because it was just THAT outstanding at Fable. I tried a few bites from my friend's plate and the beef melted in my mouth! Everything about this dish was first class, even the potatoes were of a different caliber. I will definitely order this next time and never will ""Steak Frites"" be the same for me again after experiencing Fable's version of it.


**5 Stars for Service**
Our server was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the dishes on the menu. She made everything sound incredibly delicious and really brought her personal experience into every dish she described. Her recommendations were perfect. All of the above really confirms that this place is unique and top notch in Vancouver but it was the service that elevated my experience to another level. 

After my week of experiencing mediocre, overhyped and overpriced restaurants in Vancouver, I am so excited to pour my enthusiasm into this review and urge those of you lucky enough to visit or live in the city to try it out! Fable will definitely be at the top of my list when I am back."
Fable,"Amazing meal! I had the yam and sage agnolotti with toasted almonds, broccolini and goat cheese. (I don't remember the name of the dish on the menu. I was told it was a new item, and I was the first ever to have it.) For dessert I had white chocolate mousse and rhubarb topped with crumbled toasted corn flakes (again, that wasn't the exact name of the dish; it was something like Rhubarb & Cream). Such lovely taste and interesting textures.

Friendly staff, quick service, reasonable prices, great atmosphere. Our server knew the wine list well and was able to explain what various choices were like.

Get reservations! It was crowded and we were lucky to have gotten a seat at 6pm walking in off the street. Next time I'll reserve a table.

My only suggestion was that their menus look more like they belong in a hamburger joint with the colors and fonts they chose. They could do with a redesign that looks a bit more elegant to match the presentation of their food, and on slightly thicker stock paper so it doesn't look raggedy after having been handed out a couple of times.

It was my first time there. I'll definitely be back again!"
Fable,Good service and delicious food. The dishes are good but nothing to wow about I would say. I did enjoy the octopus salad appetizer and the spaghetti and meatball appetizer. The appetizers are better than the entrees I think. The pulled pork gnocchi was alright but too heavy. Would have been better as an appetizer. Charging for bread and butter is a big no no in my books. That was a bit of a turn off.
Fable,"So my first try at Fable was pretty mediocre and in my previous review I said I wouldn't be going back but... I love brunch and did end up heading over to Fable to try it out! 

Have to say, the noise issue was much improved. Still had that busy vibe but the noise wasn't anywhere near as crazy as it was the last time so that was great. We didn't have a reservation but were seated pretty fast, maybe a 10 minute wait for them to get the table cleaned up? Perfect. 

Service was good and fast. My brunch was amazing. French toast, mascarpone cream, fruit preserves, I'm dying to go back and have it again! My brunch buddy had the steak and eggs but my meal was clearly the winner. The steak was good but with the black pepper jam it tastes pretty much like the steak they serve at dinner (still good though!)."
Fable,"Great place, great menu, great service.

Duck was moist and well flavored. Red cabbage was a smart accompaniment. Croquette was perfect ratio of confit & potato.

Make your own flatbread concept was fun & interesting. 

Canned tuna was unusual and tasty. The cured lemon was a nice touch. Comes with toast bites.

White cheddar cornbread with chipotle butter was delicious.

Pork chop was generous serving

Chicken was good, but not outstanding."
Fable,"Fable is a restaurant that I've wanted to try for a while, mostly because of their chef's fame from competing in Top Chef Canada and their emphasis on fresh dishes (farm to table = Fable!). 

Dinner service starts at 5:30pm - by the time we arrived at just before 6pm, all the tables were already filled or reserved! We grabbed a seat by the bar facing the open kitchen before all of those were taken up too. Come early!

We had a fantastic server (didn't catch her name) who had tons of energy and made everything sound delicious. I had originally decided what to get, but she convinced me to try out their special instead. 

We shared an appetizer, an entree, and two desserts. As per the server's recommendation, we had the ""Canned Tuna"" (which is an amazing sous vide tuna in a mason jar), Rib Eye steak (which was the special, and included lobster perogies and brocollini), a Blueberry Lavender Tart, and their Daily Sweet Bites (which included two pieces of a sort of almond cake, espresso macaroons, and chocolate brownies).

Everything was delicious. The ""Canned Tuna"" was a unique dish and may not be a hit with everyone. I loved the Rib Eye and the lobster perogies that came with it was just amazing. I preferred the Blueberry Lavender Tart over the Sweet Bites. Fantastic buttermilk icecream on the tart.

Prices were not overly expensive, yet at the same time not cheap. Great food, great atmosphere, and fantastic service. It was a lot of fun being able to see the chefs cook out in the open, even though the bar seats were pretty warm because of the proximity to the kitchen. If you're planning on going, definitely make a reservation!"
Fable,"I've only ever come here for brunch but it is my go-to place. Great selection of dishes, friendly staff and a nice interior. I usually get the west coast toast. The only issue is that this place is a little pricey, but it is totally worth it :)"
Fable,"Great surprise!  Food was excellent, but staff was wonderfully attentive.  Even brought our 7 month toys to play with.  Merci"
Fable,"Came last night with a party of five after hearing really great things, but I have to be honest, I was super disappointed with the majority of our experience.  We ordered: chickpea fritters, sweetbread special, flank steak special, pasta special, and an assortment of desserts. 

The chickpea fritters were the best of the savory, they were truly delicious, but not something super out of the ordinary. The outside of our sweetbread was a bit burnt and the flavours were really sub-par. The flank steak and its sides were nothing special flavour-wise, and the pasta was tiny and lacked flavor. I would give the desserts 5 stars (all amazing), but the prices were a bit too much to justify. 

Unfortunately, we also had sub-par service. Two of our entree's came out close to 10 mins before everyone else's and our server was not overly friendly or helpful (perhaps having a bad night). :(

I rarely write reviews, but I was so disappointed that I felt compelled. All-in-all, I would not go back, and I'm sad because I had really high hopes. Unfortunately, the Fable Diner was an even worse experience, so I guess that's it for Fable and I. If you're in the area, I'd say don't bother and just head to Maenam next-door. Hope you all have better luck."
Fable,The best duck I've ever ever had. And the zucchini was a pleasant surprise. Really creative dish! Make sure to Make reservation at weekends
Fable,"Great meal. I have very particular food needs and they were very accomodating. We waited a very long time for our meal, but it was worth it. The waitresses gave us alot of coffee and bits of snacks until our food arrived. 
Thank you I will be back."
Fable,"One of the hot places to eat in Vancouver. Creative take on Canadian-ish food. Small but inventive menu. Outstanding service and great food. Very small dining space so get a reservation on any day. We went on a Tuesday very early and we lucked out with one table a no show. 

The surprise for me was the non- alcoholic drink I had. Cranberry, soda, bitters and what ever else it was a drink the likes of which I have never tasted. A creative blast!

My homemade pasta and meat sauce was cooked perfectly and not too tomatoey. Very well seasoned. Ling Cod was tasty, crispy and fresh. 

Good inventive food with great service! I'll be back with a reservation next time."
Fable,"Fable Is great local and sustainable food. With season dishes they are sure to blow you away with their freshness and creativity. If you are into food, snag a seat at the bar and watch them create! Then you can see every dish before you order! The staff including the cooks are super friendly as well!

Be sure to make a reservation for a table if you're going during a busy time or for brunch 

My favorite dish is the gnocchi with pulled pork and seasonal preparations, best gnocchi I've had!"
Fable,"The prix fixe menu is amazing! Every mouthful was flavorful and satisfying. 

Also, order the Joie Muscat and pair it with the Canned Tuna. To...die...for... I've been pairing wines for 30 yrs and this among the best I've tasted. 

I had the pork croquettes, ahi tuna (apple sauce, fennel confit and radish slaw) and wrapped up with the savarin soaked with rum and served with a hard sauce. Delicious!

My wife had the cauliflower soup, risotto and Gorgonzola cheesecake (marscapone and preserved fruit). Also amazing. The cheesecake was almost too much blue cheese until you took the other accompaniments, then it was perfect!"
Fable,"Yes, I watched Top Chef Canada Season 2.  I'd been hearing all this hype, and I liked the farm to table concept.  So we went with super high expectations but were just disappointed. :( 

We ordered drinks, and the two appy specials which I believe were seared scallops w/black bean sauce and pork croquettes.  They came and were visually appealing, but teeeeeny tiny.  I could've stuffed all three croquettes in my mouth!!  So granted after the not too shabby, but puny appy's we were still pretty hungry.  

Our entrees were the potato crusted chicken, and butternut squash gnocchi.  Gnocchi, butternut squash, hazelnuts, oyster mushrooms, swiss chard? So many delicious ingredients in one plate, but it was only ok, definitely had better; but what bothered me was the portion size. I think there were maybe 12 little pieces of gnocchi on my plate?  The chicken came as a little fried log on a bed of ratatouille.  It was seriously underseasoned, and the fried potato coating reminded me of like bad fried chinese takeout foods... So obviously we skipped dessert and had to eat dinner2.0 again later.

The best thing about Fable is the servers, who were attentive and friendly.  Another thing that really bothered me was the layout. It's an open kitchen you walk by when you enter, so the dining area is in the back. HOWEVER, the pantry/fridge is in the back so there were constantly people walking back and forth carrying arm fulls of cabbages and meat and seafood? It's super awkward..."
Fable,"Happy to say my 200th review is 5*'s!

Service was impeccable; accommodating, thorough, engaging , willing to spend time describing items, and just so sweet, friendly and on the ball.

Canned tuna; did not sound appealing to us but came highly recommended by friends and was delicious.  The key is to mix it up really well, then top on the toasts provided.... Reminiscent of tuna sashimi (but cooked, but not hard like the canned tuna you're thinking of), smooth, silky, fresh.  Just try it!

Pepper jam with the steak was scrumptious, the large perfectly cooked portion of kale with the trout was very good, scallops and bacon was also great (personal preference did not care for the cauliflower velouté).

Desserts are truly high calibre, well thought out, perfectly executed and fresh.... Really, really good.

We found the wine list was not extensive but well thought out with a fair mix of expensive and reasonable wines.

Thanks Jody B. for your review, it really did eliminate my scrolling time! :)"
Fable,"I have wanted to try it for awhile and it definitely is worth it. I had imagined that it was a pricey place but actually it is really affordable w great choices. All the ingredients are from local farms and businesses and so it is exactly like its title: from Farm to Table.

The service was great. The waiter and hostess were very attentive and great. They knew their menu and food really well. Everyone was very professional. I would have to say that if you sit in the tables in the middle as two people, then it is really small unless you are guys w no coats and bags. Otherwise if you are reserving for two people only then ask for the tables on the sides to have more room area and so your neighbours aren't playing footsie or charisy with you:)

As for the food, really great! I highly recommend the canned tuna- it was divine! I always wonder what canned tuna is doing on the menu but it is so great that I can't wait to compare other canned tuna to Fable. Hard to beat I would say! Think of a beautiful sunny day running in a meadow of daffodils in your mouth. Really scrumptious and delicious. Also had the feature of the day- a mushroom oatmeal w escargot- it was so yummy and rich. I would ask for some bread to go w it or some crackers, but it is not salty on its own, just so yummy you want to savour every last bite of it! So delicious to share. Really great.

For the main, we had the flatiron steak and the halibut as well. I would say I was a bit disappointed w the flatiron steak dish- the steak itself was great and tender enough. The guilan and onions were a bit burned and charred so it was not the most enjoyable which was a bit of a letdown given the rest of the amazingness. My friend's halibut was divine and melted in your mouth! Definitely will order that next time!

The desserts were amazing. The s'mores looked so delicious and makes you want to be back at the campire w the stories and a blanket around you. The strawberry shortcake parfait was perfect. It makes you feel like a little girl w the big icecream and the berries and the spoon w the pretty bowl- just classic giddiness. Even guys will love it.

Highly recommend fable, I would try their duck and fish dishes for the main next time."
Fable,"FINALLY  a place where I can get eggs Benedict with REAL Hollandaise!!
And not busy if you come in before 12, Service was good, music was pleasant and NOT LOUD, I enjoyed my meal and will be back for sure."
Fable,It was just ok. We were looking for a brunch place with new Canadian fare and none of us were blown away. Dont come hungry either because the portions are on thr smaller side.
Fable,"Still fantastic. 
I suggest sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen to get a sneak peak at the food being prepared. Very knowledgeable service, especially detailed explanations of the cooking techniques and ingredients. Clearly a professional, dedicated staff to help you make the most out of your experience. The sommelier was very happy to come over and help us with the wine list (surprisingly extensive for a smaller, casual place) and helped us choose wines that complimented our meals. Apparently they use an inert gas contraption to draw the wines out of the bottles with a needle so that the wine never goes off and each glass is as fresh as a newly opened one. The duck meatball was the highlight of our night, don't be put off by the odd presentation. From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted so warmly to having the door held for us as we left, a stellar dining experience."
Fable,"Visited this place last week during lunch.  Nice weather, but it was completely swamped with people. Lunch took more than an hour, which was the downside.

Otherwise, food was decent, I wanted to order the burger, but it was sold out.  It was a big disappointment.  Hence, I ordered the Vegetarian pasta with Chorizo added.  Tasted like cream-pesto pasta, which was good but nothing crazy.  I liked the overall ambience but service was relatively slow.  My brother had the eggs benedict which was above average.

Will return again but I hope that they would stock enough burgers for me next time :)"
Fable,"Food tasted amazingly fresh. I had the eggs benedict with the ham along with the pulled pork Johnny cakes. The hollandaise sauce was not overpowering with the lemon juice, which pulled in all of the subtle flavors of the delicious ham. I usually don't like savory and sweet dishes, but the Johnny cakes was an exception. I loved the pulled pork and jalapeños stuffed in the pancake, and it was so flavorful that I didn't even need to add maple syrup to it. Service was exceptional and the waitresses there were patient with our big group of 7. I would definitely come back."
Fable,"Yummy! Had gnocchi and salad~~ perfectly plated and the tastes were subtle magic. Staff was attentive and didn't miss a beat (except to refill drink orders). Easy, casual ambiance. A happy go-to if you're in Kits and need a bite."
Fable,"They serve one of the most creamiest tomato soup I've had. The eggs Benedict is delicious, ours came with English muffin and pulled pork. I enjoyed the side of potato cake and the salad. The dressing is sweet and flavourful. Excellent customer service."
Fable,"Couldn't think of any negative things to say about Fable. Truly a masterful dinner with creative and well executed dishes. Service was great as well. Fable is now on my ""must go back"" list.

I loved the potato gnocchi, one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had in a long time. A beautiful plate of food in every sense.

The lemon meringue parfait is mind blowing."
Fable,"So nice.  I'm veggie and often at ""farm to table"" places the menu is very animal protein heavy, with sparse vegetarian offering.  Not here!  I had a hard time making up my mind.  I sampled a few appetizers, the squash blossoms were the best.  The Barrata was also very good.  The chickpea fritters were good but not as great as the first too.  I had the pea gnocchi for a main.  It was yummy and a generousness portion. I'm a sucker for a cheese plate and they do a nice one... a subtle blue, Comox brie and something sharp that I've forgotten but was nice.  They all paired well and were sett off by a lovely assortment of toast, walnuts and sweetness.  

If I lived closer they'd be in my regular rotation of places."
Fable,"We have been here so many times but never written a review.  Service is amazing, everyone is super friendly and professional.  Canned tuna is great, all of brunch is fabulous and wines are well curated.  Sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook if you are foodie, a real treat!"
Fable,"Had a really, really nice dinner here with my daughter. The focaccia was warm, moist, and flavorful, and the duck meatball pasta appetizer was a perfect introduction to the entree. Our cod was nicely seasoned, and just enough for the two of us. We capped the meal off with the s'mores dessert - highly recommended. The waitress was attentive and helpful without being intrusive."
Fable,Quality food pretty good! Nice environment and is OK to come with a small group of friends.
Fable,Went for the dineout dinner menu. Servings were very small and neither my friend or I were full at the end. I had the lingcod which was a little dry and rather bland. Sat at the back under the electronic screen which would hit our heads if we leaned back too far. Dessert was good though. Probably wouldn't come back.
Fable,"I have compiled a short list of Vancouver restaurants that have garnered notoriety on Yelp over the past few years. One of these restaurants is in the heart of Kits called Fable. 

Upon first seeing the restaurant from the streets, it appears it will be quite small and crowded. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how it opens up when you access the rear portion of the restaurant. As we were seated, I felt as though we were in a comfy, neighbourhood establishment that the community enjoys visiting on a regular basis. 

My wife gazed up at the ceiling and noticed a pitch fork as one of the stylistic pieces as a part of the lighting. It was quite interesting. Overall the ambience was energetic. The crowd was a bit too noisy for my liking as I had to raise my voice quite often to speak with the guests at my table. I'm never a fan of leaving a restaurant with a sore throat - so my only 'major' knock on this place is the volume. 

The food was outstanding. As an appetizer, I got to try their tomato soup which was ""poured"" into my bowl, piping hot. My taste buds were jumping for joy while enjoying this dish. We moved onto the entrees shortly thereafter. My wife got to enjoy the rissotto and I their gnocchi (with a side of pulled pork). The gnocchi dish was a generous portion given how filing the meal can be. I was very pleased. The squash accent was the perfect amount. I must give full marks for this. 

Service was above par. We had a group of four and with relative ease our server split the bill. Dishes were served in a timely manner and the waiters/waitresses were kept a good pulse of the conversation/body language to estimate when was the best time to approach the table. I value this quite a bit. 

Again, great restaurant - just a bit too noisy for my liking. This is to be expected though when you go to a smaller establishment with many people."
Fable,The BPJ (black pepper jam) is the bomb! Good services and reasonable price. One of my favorite places for brunch.
Fable,"Amazing dishes mostly organic.  Great flavour and great selection.

One of my favourite date night/ couples night spots.

The steak is great and the fish is even better!!"
Fable,"A friend and I happened to walk by and thought... well let's try this place out.
OMG - so glad we did.
Best dinner EVER.!  great service, so friendly and nice. Great drinks!!!
Price is perfect for the quality of food being served.
Can't go wrong here."
Fable,"So happy that I finally got to check out Fable.  I am a big fan of the Top Chef series and heard lots of positive comments about Fable.

The set up is neat with the open kitchen right when you walk in. My friend and I sat at the dining area which was further back. Next time I'll grab some seats right at the kitchen so I can watch the chefs cook.

The stand out food items we had were definitely the ""canned tuna"" and the house bread special cornbread. I had the gnocchi entree which was good although I prefer having them pan-seared instead. My friend liked her flat iron steak which came with a delicious potato fondant.

I will definitely come back to Fable again with friends to try other things on the menu."
Fable,"Tough to get into and they don't do reservations for weekend brunch, but this is the best brunch I've had in Vancouver, and I bet their dinners are great too. Just excellent food, creativity and attention to detail. But seriously, expect to wait at least an hour in line here unless you come at a weird time."
Fable,"Love the concept and execution.  The starters were a little underwhelming but the entrees knocked it out of the park.

They are seemingly famous for their 'canned tuna' - it needed a bit of acid and some crunch.  I wouldn't get it again. 

The signature cocktails weren't great - but the beer selection was.

Service was amazing."
Fable,"The first time I went to Fable was for an anniversary with my boyfriend which he reserved out of a good recommendation.

We were greeted at the door and right away taken to our seats. We were impressed with the host and server's friendliness and how they acknowledged our anniversary and our food restrictions (I am a vegetarian). 

We ordered drinks and started with the chickpea fritters and the salad they had at the time and we were completely blown away by the chickpea fritters!! The curried sauce is unbelievable!! If it came in a bottle, I would definitely put it on everything.

For our main course, he ordered the seared fish and I order the butternut squash pesto gnocchi. One bite in and we were both in awe! I have traveled Italy and have had a lot of gnocchi but this gnocchi was hands down the best I have ever tried. They were like little soft pillows that melted away in my mouth -- perfect texture and consistency. My boyfriend raved about the fish dish as well. 

While a full-course meal at Fable can be on the pricey side, it is well worth it. We have both agreed that Fable is our favourite restaurant in Vancouver and have made it our official monthly anniversary dinner place. We have been going there for the past 3 months and the last time he phoned to make a reservation, they recognized who he was, asking ""and your wife is a vegetarian, yes?"" which suggests how impressive their service is. The high-quality service combined with the high-quality ingredients and dishes makes Fable not only a place to eat, but an experience. Each month we anticipate what the menu will consist of and what type of gnocchi dish I will be devouring. 

We thank Fable for having us each month and providing a consistently beautiful experience!"
Fable,"Very, very tasty! Amazing meld of flavors.  Steak and potatoes and asparagus YUM! Great service, almost a bit too attentive- we counted at least 5 different people who attended to our table.  I'd definitely visit again."
Fable,"Dropped in with my wife (without a reservation) around 530pm on Saturday night before going to see a show. Only seats were at the bar which was great because we got to watch the action from the open kitchen. Luckily we got seated next to Edwin, one of the managers at Fable, who was very friendly and helpful. We had a great meal and will definitely be coming back. Thanks again Edwin!"
Fable,"Enjoyable eating experience, in particular the chickpea appetizer and the smores dessert! Also enjoyed their fine array of mocktails that didn't make me feel like I missed out by not drinking alcohol.

Service was really rescued by our main server as I felt the ""additional"" service provided by food runners was a bit overdone. She made us feel as if a genuine non-scripted person was attending to our needs.

Why not a 5? Guess some experiences in other places has caused me to become a harder marker. ;)"
Fable,"The staff were all very lovely, the wait was minimal and my meal was delicious.  The decor and ambiance was somehow elegant and rustic at the same time. Great date night place."
Fable,"Despite the fact that place was practically empty, they tried to rush us to order saying that it would fill up soon. Staff was not friendly or accommodating. We wanted to take dessert to go and they refused to pack ice cream up,which means we payed for a few crumbles of brownie."
Fable,Really nice room and good service. The food was very good. Good spot for a romantic dinner. I would go back.
Fable,This place has really delicious and fresh food. Well paired local finds! Veggie friendly options! I would go again!!
Fable,"A cool cat and slick hippo waltzed into a quaint little cave with a warm and friendly vibe. Learning that they'd have to wait a bit since it was a buzzing Friday with tons of bees, they were happy to first go around the corner and lap up a drink from a popular watering hole. The cat, in particular, loved admiring the cute guppy servers there.

Soon enough, the pleasant bunny beckoned for them to return and seated them at the bar where they were served by a slow but friendly turtle. The cat ordered her standard milk, and the hippo a huge vat of water. They started off with the yummy chick pea fritters.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p5thThuUITUjAy8gS3sPMw?userid=1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg#S7BmtrinebGL3cjQCeDzJA
 It was spiced similar to a pekora. Yummy, but a bit dry. The hippo enjoyed it, even if it wasn't native to his home, but the cat was eagerly anticipating her fish.

Then they ordered the chorizo encrusted halibut. This blew the hippo, as big as he was, quite out of the water and of course, it was a given that this would be the cat's favourite dish; they also tried the steak. The cat, being a carnivore, enjoyed this dish, too; the hippo was not as impressed.  They both enjoyed the delectable and divine sauces, and the cat actually licked the plate clean.

The cat thought she'd try the flourless chocolate cake, since she loved chocolate while the hippo was happy with his rhubarb choice. It was even better than the grass that he was accustomed to foraging. Instead of a special coffee, the cat ordered yet another bowl of fine milk. It was Friday night, after all!

http://www.yelp.com/bi...

The cat still loved her fish dish the best, which was not surprising. Then the pleasant proprietor, an energetic bird came over to ask their thoughts. He was certainly interesting enough and it was nice that he bothered to fly over however briefly, at the end. A hawk, who they assumed was the manager, also inquired after their meal. He was quite friendly and professional. They were only sorry that they didn't get to meet the clever dragon but he was too busy firing up his next dessert.
A visit to the loo was pleasing for the hippo as he felt at home in the bamboo and the cat was able to sharpen her claws on the toilet paper branch.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p5thThuUITUjAy8gS3sPMw?userid=1h1DD2hgfgud7V4NCE9mVg#XtMN9aAJi8ab2PZkcBvEpw

Overall, both animals decided on a bit higher than a solid four. The moral of this little fable is that just one visit was not enough. They departed for their evening nap, vowing to return quite soon to try the remaining kibbles."
Fable,"This place was adorable. It was ram packed, but I get why - the decore was rustic/french, with pitchforks and beautiful wooden beams. The food was tapas-style, and we got a ton of different plates to try it all. 

Definitely will return."
Fable,"It's important to preface this with the fact that Refuel was one of my favourite spots, and I was upset when they closed.  I'd heard a new place was opening but I thought to myself ""they're never going to beat Refuel, right?""  Well, turns out, wrong.

Fable is awesome.  Brunch club sat down at 11 (they took a reservation, which is worth a star in it's own right for saturday brunch in Vancouver).  The waiter was super casual but extremely cool.  I ordered the Fable Egg with sausage on the side.  Egg sunny side up (my favourite, cooked to perfection) on top of lardons, potatoes and tomato jam.  Yes, tomato jam.  It was friggin' delicious jam.  

There were a few of us who couldn't decide on whether to order the sausage on the side or just get the farmer breakfast sandwich (important note, this isn't on the menu but I asked and it's going to be soon, as is the sausage by itself) so the waiter just told us to order the sausage because it'd be cheaper and he comped us the sandwich which we cut up and shared.  Amazing.  And this sausage?  Probably the best one I've had at brunch in vancouver in years.  maybe ever.  Made from a pig they had delivered for a dinner special earlier in the week, lovely flavors with a nice finish of spice.  Amazing.  Did I say that already?  Too bad.

All in all I don't have any complaints about Fable.  You should probably go there before everyone else finds them and they get crazy busy.  And order the sausage."
Fable,"This is an outstanding restaurant. The food is excellent, environment great and the wait staff excellent. Strongly recommend."
Fable,"DELICIOUS! yummy food that is still
Close to home. Has an option for everyone from duck to steak to chicken. The canned tuna is clever and yummy. I recommend the duck breast! Absolutely scrumptious"
Fable,"An hour later, I'm still thinking about how good the food was ! Love the concept, that every thing is fresh from the farm and delicious :) You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and the flavor was also abundant. We went there for lunch, and the lunch menu, although limited, was varied enough to accommodate meat lovers and vegetarians. They also didn't seem to mind modifying some ingredients to make them work for you.

The price ranges from $8 - $10 for a lunch sandwich, and it's enough o fill you up ! Delicious fresh food at a great price is the reason I will definitely be returning to this place again - maybe for brunch next time."
Fable,"OMG!  I just wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did, and even more than that, I found it GREAT VALUE unlike many fine dining establishments here in Vancouver...This place wasn't the vibe of FINE dining, but the food definitely was.

I'm a Reality TV show junkie and Top Chef (USA) is my fave show of them all.  I watch so much of  Reality shows, I barely remember anyone after the show ends.  The only thing I could tell my friend was I remembered Trevor finished 2nd and I think I liked him.  I didn't even remember who WON!  (I read the re-cap of the final last night when I got home and remembered I wanted Trevor to win.....I'd have to watch it over to be 100% positive though)...

Anyway, when we walked in, Trevor greeted us and I turned into a star-struck idiot.  He said hello and asked us how we were and I froze and put on a goofy smile and said, ""Hi Trevor!"".  (You would have had to see me to know how goofy I looked).  I'm still embarrassed and wished I would have said ""Hi, CHEF Trevor"". I also saw Trista and remembered I didn't like her though I told my friend her name was Trisha...I can't remember why I didn't like her, but I know I didn't...

The food was so good!  Everything was balanced perfectly in flavour and texture!  I was in bliss.  The highlight was the special  of ""beef cheeks"".  I was so full at this point after three appies, but I finished it ALL!  First time I tried ""salsify"" too!  What an awesome dish!  I love root veggies so this dish was a perfect choice for me.

My friend had the potato crusted chicken which she said she had never had chicken as tender as that before.  We had the canned tuna, duck meatball and a special of ""Top Chef Carl's (the winner) charcuterie.  My friend's fave of the evening  was the duck meatball. All was excellent and the pricing was even better.  That with great, friendly service made this a 5-star meal!

I raved to everyone at work today and another co-worker and I will be going in two weeks.  I want to try everything there is at this restaurant!  YUM!!!  What a pleasant experience!"
Fable,"Yelp hasn't failed me :-). Awesome food, great ambiance, friendly staff and fair prices.

Got the onion gnocchi and honestly it was one of the best gnocchi I had in a long time. Finished the meal with a lemon parfait that was delicious.

Parking can be a little tricky, but totally worth the effort. Will definitely come back again."
Fable,One of my favorite restaurants in Vancouver. The food is unbelievably delicious and service has always been great (though you'll likely wait a long time for a table if you don't reserve!).
Fable,"Ventured out to Fable on Saturday night with a few friends.

I wasn't expecting much because 4th really doesn't have much to offer in terms of REALLY good food. Well well, I was pleasantly surprised! 

Our group started with:
- Canned tuna (5 stars)
- Crispy and raw spot prawns (4 stars)
- Mushroom flatbread (3 stars - the bread was nearly impossible to cut through)
- Sawmill creek oysters (5 stars)

For our mains:
- Flat iron steak served with brocollini and potato (4 stars)
- Duck served with scallion perogie, green beans and cauliflower x 2 (3 stars - fairy bland)
- Halibut with chorizo sausage, gnocchi in a cream sauce with a medley of veggies (5 stars)

We downed two bottles of wine - a french pinot noir and a BC pinot gris.

For the 4 of us, our bill came to $370 (tip and tax included). 

I can't wait to go back and try some more food!"
Fable,"EXCELLENT!!!!!! - love the concept, decor and food.  Please open a location in Yaletown"
Fable,"I can't believe that I have forgotten to write a review for this great place in Kits. I have been here numerous times for appies, dinner and this time for dessert!

The decor is minimalist that's why I didn't give this place 5 stars. The view from the bar is amazing though so I highly recommend sitting at the bar to get a glimpse of what running a restaurant on busy night is like.

Our server was friendly but a little bit pushy with the number of times she dropped by. I like the relaxed vibe of this joint, way more relaxed than anywhere downtown. 

Let's get to the desserts, we tried a Lemon Meringue Parfait and the cheese plate. The Parfait has many layers and is a combination of sour, crumbly and sweet flavours...a must try! The cheese plate was a bit dull as the selection wasn't that special. 

Overall when in Kitsilano, you have to give Fable a try as you'll be glad you did!"
Fable,"Definitely two thumbs up. It's been on my radar for a while, and especially since seeing all of the great Yelp reviews out so far. The food is definitely ""from farm to table"" and you can taste how fresh it is from the first bite.

First of all, they have wonderful service. The servers are extremely friendly, patient and know how to deal with kids as we saw the table next to us. 

We ordered the appetizer of the day, which was some sort battered and fried fish neck, cabbage taco with sweet ginger/tamarind sauce and pickled carrot and beets. The fish was very fresh and meaty and not too oily considering it had been deep fried. 

We followed this with the steelhead trout for me and herb crusted halibut for my mom. We love seafood, and these two dishes definitely did not disappoint. My trout came out pink and perfectly cooked on a bed of kale with mushroom vinaigrette. I adore kale and I loved how they had both crispy and sauteed kale in the dish. I also tried a bite of my mom's halibut and it was fresh, flavorful but nice and light for a late-ish evening meal.

We finished with the lemon meringue parfait on the server's recommendation and it was AMAZING. I loved the meringue on top and the tarragon ice cream underneath. I never thought I'd enjoy tarragon ice cream, but it complemented the dessert really well. The lemon part was tangy but sweet, and the graham crackers added texture to an otherwise smooth dessert.

Overall, it came out to about 80 dollars for the both of us. Considering the great service, food and ambiance, it was a great deal and I'll definitely be coming back in the future."
Fable,"Great food and AMAZING service! Had the fried chickpeas as a starter and they were delicious! Want to go back just to eat them again. 
My main was the steak and it was good but not exceptional. For dessert we had the s'mores which come with homemade marshmallows! By far the best marshmallows I have ever tired!! Cant wait to eat here again."
Fable,"Me and my friend Jonas LaForge had a great time at this restaurant. We ordered the steak and frites and the steak was cooked to perfection. The Atmosphere was great for a good get together with an old friend.

Next time we will have a few more of the drinks and stay longer but we had a wonderful time."
Fable,"I had high hopes for Fable, but sadly they didn't deliver. My partner and I came in for a quick dinner and had a tough time choosing what to order because - we didn't really want anything that the menu had to offer! Thats a new one...Anyway we settled on chick pea fritters to start - they were okay, imagine falafel - there you have it. For our mains we had the chicken and the duck - the duck was better but everything seemed to have a 'sweet' after taste to it. Very strange. 

Meals are homey, heavy and more like 'wintery' fare. 

Service was good. Very attentive."
Fable,"Got the opportunity to dine at Fable on a recent trip to Vancouver with two of my friends.  I can't say enough about the restaurant.  Trevor and Curtis had their A-games on that night.  Being a little budget conscious as grad school students, we had to try and make the most of our ""splurge"" meal without having to take out a loan to finance it.  

Food wise, the highlight of the meal was the proclaimed ""best canned tuna"".  My friends and I didn't even order it, initially, but Trevor insisted on us trying it and actually comped us.  It had lots to live up to with a name like that, and it exceeded my expectations.  The tuna is jarred with potatoes, lemon, tomato and olive oil and slowed cook over time.  Once you open the jar, crush, and mix the contents, you're in for a delightful experience.  There's a sense of intense richness with the refreshing hint of lemon.  All of my friends agreed that when topped over the toasted bread, it reminded us of sort of a savory lemon bar.  

The food was definitely worth the trip, in and of itself; however, the highlight of the night was sitting at the counter facing the kitchen.  It was there where we got to see Trevor and company do what they do best.  Trevor, Curtis, and the whole staff were so personable and interactive throughout the whole meal.  For me, food is just a part of the dining experience (an important one, of course), but the atmosphere and interaction with the staff is also important.  By the end of the night, it was almost as if we had been friends with Trevor et al. for a long time.  We were treated that well!  

So in a nutshell, I'd highly recommend Fable.  Be sure to get a spot at the kitchen counter, and hopefully you're experience will be as memorable as ours!"
Fable,"Beyond yum. Quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in Vancouver, BC. Fresh and delightful food options that get more delicious course by course.  Enjoyed the Mussels with Chorizo with a broth so good you will want to drink it. You can keep it classy and dip the grilled bread accompanying it instead. Chicken wings are perfectly crisp and sauced. The Corn Gnocchi with Pesto and Pulled Pork is an epic delight. Drinks are as beautiful as they are tasty and unique. Always experience great attentive service. Definitley make a reservation of course food this fantastic is in demand. Get on the list and you won't be sorry. Fable is a magnificent adventure for tastebuds."
Fable,"We went there for my birthday dinner and everything was fabulous. 

Starting with appetizer 

-Canned tuna. It's nothing like canned tuna. It is made with albacore tuna and layered with potato and lemons, it was so GOOD! 
-Liver. It was quite good too but won't be my favourite. 
-Meatball. My friend had it and he was so yummy. His only complaint was that he wished he could have more.

Main:

-Duck. I love duck breast and this was cooked perfect. The pickled beets on the side was perfect side.
-Flat iron steak. My hubby had it and he said it was good and he loved the sides that it came with. I can't remember what they were but apparently very delicious.

Now on to the highlight of the meal. I mean everything was fabulous but their dessert was out of this world good. I could have licked the whole bowl if I was in the privacy of my house.

-Lemon pot de cream. It was lemony custard with gin foam and grenada. Holy crap was it good!!! Not too sweet and too lemony, it was just the right amount of sweetness that I needed after a big meal. 
-Opera torte. My sister had it and it wasn't too sweet and didn't make me feel like I was eating a cup of sugar. And the espresso ice cream and the chocolate was like a match made in heaven.

Cocktails:

I had kiss from rose, gin with rose syrup. I have to learn how to make this because it was too damn good. 

The dinner was fantastic and we were all happy at the end of the meal."
Fable,"Popped in for lunch. Anyone can make a nice burger or a tasty pasta. So, the real test of a restaurant lies in its creativity and standards.

Ordered the Chick Pea Fritters and Ling Cod. Weird. The check pea friiter was over-roasted. Covered by a thick layer of mayo dressing. The ling cod was a few tasty pieces of cod sitting on a salad. Also covered by a thick layer of dressing.

My impression is that the kitchen crew are young and experimental; featuring sharp favours. But, not always combining the favours in a harmonious blend.

I remarked that there was too much salad dressing on the food. The manager apologized and offered a free dessert. A plus for them.

I would recommend that diners should stick to conventional foods in this restaurant."
Fable,"(Thank you Michael L, we ""stopped and went no further"" lol...)

 EPIC MIND-BLOWING dinner we have ever had. Steak Fritte and gnocchi (with pork belly) for main and chickpea fritters for appie. The food was so good, that it took over our conversation for the entire evening! 

Don't let the $12 sticker shock on the Caesar fool you... I would almost classify it as an appetizer (candied pork belly on a stick, with a unique gazpacho base)

The staff have a remarkable peaceful ""Ora"" ... makes you think that there may be something to all the yoga, organic, non-gmo lifestyle! 

I wish I had room to order more items from their menu... maybe next time."
Fable,"The best restaurant I've ever been too, period. And yes, I've been to Hawksworth, Wildebeest and the like so I do have something to compare it to. 

Brunch, lunch, dinner or just a drink at the end of a long day. There is no better place for me in the city. The flavors that explode off of each dish that is served are just insane. And right inline with that is the wicked staff. Their ability to paint a visual picture of everything new the Chef creates is awesome. 

I recommend you start with an Oak & Coke and a canned Tuna, and let it all flow from there... I can't pick just one main, as the menu is freshened up so often dependent on the fresh ingredients, that of course are sourced locally. But I can guarantee you can't go wrong."
Fable,Another place where the owner/chef cares about the food he serves that he is starting growing some of the food on the roof of the establishment. Seasonal food done right. Love it!
Fable,"Home of my favourite dish in the whole world, the duck meatball with tagliatelle. Once when I was eating here a coat rack accidentally fell on me and I got free dessert so that was nice too. I chose the lemon meringue parfait, the earl grey ice cream is subtle and delicious."
Fable,"Good atmosphere. The spaghetti and meatball appy is good. One time we ordered it, it was over salted though. Not a fan of the canned tuna, not sure why it's so popular there but hey everyones personal preferences are different. Food is fresh and unique here."
Fable,"My brother has a tendency of going to fancy places when we go visit places. It's a tad annoying. However, my brother's best friend (a Vancouver local) suggested Fable to us for our last brunch in Vancouver.

It was definitely packed in there when we went. We waited about 15 minutes, and we were seated right away (which was pretty surprising). 

I, myself, got the scrambled eggs: Fable brioche, rosti. O.M.G. It was one of the best scrambled eggs I ever had in my life (I kid you not). I was super impressed by the place. What can you say, hipsters know how to do their brunch.

Will definitely come back here when I go back to Vancouver!"
Fable,"I went to fable for a ""boozy brunch"" (last Sunday of every month) with my girlfriends. They had all been before and raved about it so needless to say I had pretty high expectations. 

The good: the booze was indeed boozy and very, very reasonable.

The okay: The French toast. I ate it, but it wasn't anything special. Too soft in the middle 

The bad: We were rushed (out before an hour even though our seating was for an hour and a half). It took forever to any drinks to make it to us. They were out of ketchup because (direct quote) ""someone forgot to make it this morning."" My girlfriends Benny was undercooked and she didn't get any compensation or a new plate. My four dollar bacon side was ONE piece of bacon. It was good but clarify that somewhere.

My friends even said they were appalled by the service and that they had never had an experience like this prior. Maybe it was a bad day for Fable, but I won't be returning based on this experience."
Fable,"We had friends coming in from out of town and thought that it would be a great opportunity to try out this restaurant we've heard so much about. The hype is all true - we all enjoyed beautifully prepared dishes in a room the reflects Vancouver so well. Great atmosphere, some crowd noise, but not overwhelming so. You get the feeling of being in a well liked, comfortable place, and can still carry on a conversation with a table of friends. Our server was very friendly and professional. When we asked for recommendations, she proceeded to explain each of the items in more detail and helped us make excellent choices. Portions were quite generous, and certainly filling. Lots of great flavours! I had the Onion Gnocchi with pulled pork and certainly would do so again. I sampled the canned tuna which was also excellent. Our friends from San Fran loved the vibe of the room, the friendly wait staff and overall experience. 

We will definitely return! Highly recommended!"
Fable,"I don't know what they put in their food but it's addictive. I often have aggressive cravings for Fable! Needless to say, the food is amazing. The service is alway great too but the space is a bit too jammed for my liking (though like I said the food makes up for it). My favourite items on the menu are: Spaghetti and meatballs, Beef Burger, House green salad, the wild salmon!"
Fable,"I came here with my husband for his birthday. We had always heard great reviews about Fable so I was looking forward to trying, while at the same time keeping relatively neutral expectations. I made reservations a couple days in advance for 8pm. We were seated right away to a small table in the middle of the dining area. We were starving, so we ordered the chickpea fritters and the canned tuna. Of the two appetizers, I think we preferred the chickpea fritters. The tuna was definitely unlike anything I've eaten anywhere else and was interesting, but I don't know if it was as out of this world as a lot of other reviewers made it out to be. Although I enjoyed the light lemony flavor and unique texture of the potatos and tuna, I just wasn't blown away. Still worth trying at least once though. 

For entrees I ordered the onion gnocchi with pulled pork, and husband ordered the flat iron steak with veggies. The flavors for both dishes were great. The pulled pork was amazingly soft and tender, and the gnocchi were large in size, but soft and pillowy -- not at all heavy like one might expect from a carby Italian-inspired dish. Husband had not tried flat iron steak before and didn't know what to expect but it was flavorful, not too tough, and cooked perfectly medium rare. Service was good. Our server was friendly, and various staff apologized when our entrees came late. They went the extra step by comping our dessert, the s'more brownie, which was a really nice thing to do. Overall it was a good experience at Fable. One comment would be that it's not the largest restaurant, and so it gets very loud when at full capacity. Not the fault of the restaurant of course, but it's something worth mentioning in case you're considering this place for a quiet romantic date. I would definitely come back to try out their brunch."
Fable,"My boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out for awhile but seems to always be slammed. We started with the chickpea fritters tonight. Presentation was on point but it was an overkill on the salt. For our main entrees we ordered the steelhead trout and the duck breast. I'm a big fish eater (I but when I took my first bite the trout was really fishy. I asked our server if it was suppose to be made this raw. He took it back and made it ""medium"". When it came back, it was better but still fishy. The kale salad that came with the trout was drenched in a super salty vinegary dressing. The duck breast with quinoa was an good overall dish.   I hope it was just an off day for the kitchen cause we were quite disappointed."
Fable,"Amazing!!!  Try their gnocchi it was so favorable/

Very cute restaurant, everything is made fresh, and very good customer service. Even the owner might great you at your table, he does that often."
Fable,"First impressions are key -- and the hostess starts you off on a winning note. Both times I've been here, there was a wait. The hostess took my name and number and offered to call when a table was ready. With prime location on West 4th, my dining companions and I have had ample time to walk around and do some window shopping while waiting for our table. When the table was ready, the hostess fired off a quick text and call to let me know. 

The place is always packed, but doesn't feel loud or overly crowded. Service is friendly and attentive. Prices are fair and the quality is excellent. The cocktails are delicious. The canned tuna is fantastic. The chickpea fritters are great. The lemon meringue parfait is really freaking good. Trust Jody B's review on this menu item. 

In terms of the main meals, my selections were very tasty both times but did not blow my mind. The first time I went for dinner, I really wanted the squash gnocchi but ordered the steelhead trout instead because both my dining companions ordered my first choice dish. I took one for the team to add a bit of variety but wished I had gotten the gnocchi after all. My meal was excellent, no complaints, but it was no gnocchi. My second visit was for brunch and I ordered the ""Fable Eggs"" dish. As a savory flavors fan, the tomato jam's sweetness was a touch heavy but I still finished every bite. My dining companion and I did not, however, finish the rosti side dish which was a little dry. My one complaint would be that I really really wish they had the canned tuna available during the brunch service. Is that a complaint, though? 

Overall, I am a big fan of this place but it's not quite a 5 star for me. One final impression -- the hostess remembered my name as she thanks us for coming upon our exit. Nicely done, and that perfect little touch that means a lot and tells me this is the kind of place I want to come back to again and again."
Fable,"Best ever eating experience in the town. Delicious and fine foods corner. Not too much pricy, staff is good and cooperative. May be in my next visit fable can earn 5 stars from me :)"
Fable,"We were in town for three days and went to as many restaurants as possible.  We had to eat at 9 pm to get into Fable, clearly they are very popular.  We enjoyed Chambar immensely, and highly recommend that as a first choice in town.  

We started with the cornbread.  It was probably the best cornbread I have ever had.  Really special, and recommend it.

My spouse had the special beef which was prepared in a sous vide.  The piece of meat was extremely fatty (to be expected I imagine with the cut) to the point that half of the serving was inedible.  Not sure how to work around that it was just a bit disappointing.  The pepper jelly they served it with had a bit of a soy kick to it and just really didn't make sense with everything else on the plate.  As components, it was good in total.  As a dish, it just didn't work.

I had the Onion Gnocchi with pulled pork.  Again... As components, it was passable. But it was so confusing as a dish.  He gnocchi was good on its own, but the pesto was SO salty.  Alone, it was fine, but it needed something in the plate to calm it down.  The pulled port was actually really good pulled pork, but it made absolutely no sense with the dish.  It ended up feeling like I had gone through a buffet line (a really good buffet line, given) and picked up random items.

The drinks were decent.

We ended up not getting dessert because I was frustrated with the food.  

The service was excellent, and the vibe in the restaurant was great.

I almost never send things back in a restaurant.  I really feel, especially at a high end place like this, that I want your first and best effort.  And, in this case, it wasn't a skill issue, it was a dish creation issue.  To compare to Chambar, I felt like the dishes there were all inspired- everything on the plate made so much sense together that I found myself carefully constructing bites to make sure I was not missing out on anything.  

At the end of the day, I think that clearly this is one of the better places to eat in town.  I just really think some work needs to be done with a critical eye to flavor and texture combinations.  The chef is skilled and the experience is positive.  At the end of the day, the food is what matters most.  Next time we are in Vancouver we probably would give it another shot."
Fable,"Good food, not great. Over-sauced, under-seasoned, uninspired presentation. The room is ugly and cramped once guests arrive. We ate there with friends on a very cold, snowy night. Arrived 5:25 for a 5:30 dinner, were made to wait outside until 5:30 on the dot. I've worked in restaurants before, i understand wanting to wait to the last minute to have to start the onslaught, but that's stupid service: would have been easy to say come in, sit down, we can't serve you till 530 but at least keep warm. Better yet, 'here's a drink while you wait.' There was a guy in a wheelchair who they seated right in the high-traffic area, so servers and customers had to jostle him or other customers to get around. Again, easy problem to solve, unnoticed or unimportant to the staff."
Fable,Fantastic food and atmosphere.  Had a great rich and we sat at the bar facing the prep cooks.  Super funky and you really see the effort and excellence being put into your food prep.   Looking for a hip place to have amazing food check it out.
Fable,"Fable has to be one of my favorite restaurants right now!.
This place is on Kits right on 4th ave and Trevor Bird is the main guy here! (There's a reason why he was on Top Chef Canada!).
The place isn't big but definitely cozy. As soon as you walk-in, the greeter takes your name down. 
Every time I have been there, I had to wait a bit. It gets packed and no wonder why...believe me; it is worth it!.
The service is great, the waitresses are super friendly.
The kitchen is right by the entrance so you get to see the guys cooking their butts off while you wait (such an art!!!).
I love their smoked trout bennies and their french toast for brunch.
It is just perfection on a plate!. Great flavours, textures, colours. 
Their eggs are amazing!!! Just out of the farm!.
Their main vision is using local ingredients.
Fable never disappoints!!!.
Great success for a great restaurant!
All the best guys and keep it up!.
5 stars!!!!"
Fable,My favorite brunch in town! You know that feeling when you ate something so good without the disgusting fat feeling afterwards-- well this is the place to get that feeling back.
Fable,"I have been here many times now, and each time was a five star experience. Although I enjoyed my experience for lunch, what I was really impressed with is the brunch, served only on weekends. The menu changes regularly, but I have never had a dish anything less than fabulous. The scrambled eggs with Fable brioche and potato were was my favorite brunch item. The eggs were soft and buttery, but not runny, and topped with bacon and spinach. The potatoes were more like hash browns--crisp and golden on the outside and soft inside. My other favorite dish was the benedict with salmon confit. The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful. It's the perfect way to start a weekend."
Fable,Fantastic food and service. Loved the relaxed atmosphere around great food. The canned tuna appetizer was surprisingly delicious!
Fable,"Really, really good. Excellent service, and the food was just great, every single dish. Chickpea fritters have been on my mind since, and the DIY salmon collar tacos (a special that night) were ridiculously tasty. My gnocchi and pulled pork main dish was large and in charge; they do not skimp on portions! Would definitely return to this place next time I'm in Vancouver."
Fable,"Headed over to Fable on a Saturday morning for brunch with some friends from out of town. I expected it to be Portlandia-esque with a lineup out the door right when it opened. To my surprise, we didn't wait long at all. Even more surprising, we weren't turned away when we said only 2 of a party of 4 were present. We were seated right away. 

The decor looked relatively the same as the old Refuel but it was nice before, and still is. 

The menu looked VERY appetizing. It's not so big that the indecisive being in all of us would circle round and round before settling on something, and not so small that you are only presented with 5 different ways to eat an egg for brunch. Everyone at our table ordered something different. The special of the day was a smoked salmon benny. Being farm to table, we figured the salmon would be pretty fresh. 

I had the omelette (which came topped with mushroom and REAL bacon bits) with a side of salad (interesting brunch menu item), and a brick of rosti. I also ordered a side of sausage mainly because I was interested in trying their tomato jam. 

The omelette was perfect. It wasn't runny and was so fluffy. The mushrooms were very sweet and of course the bacon was the icing on the cake. I would have liked to have the mushrooms and bacon inside the omelette but this was also good. It also could have used some gooey cheddar goodness. 

The side sausage was also amazing. I half expected a traditional sausage. What I didn't expect (and what I got) was a handmade sausage patty with tomato jam. The jam was a great twist on regular ketchup. It was sweet and the texture was tomato bits which was a welcome change from the squirt bottle Heinz. 

The overall serving size was great value for money. Considering the other brunch options in the neighbourhood, along with the premium usually charged for local organic fare, this was great value for very high quality food. 

I'd definitely come back and try a benny or come back to sample their dinner menu."
Fable,"The ultimate taste makers. Love their foods and services. The place is very pleasant and calm, would love to visit them again and again. Great guys. Keep it up. Cheers !!"
Fable,"Excellent! ! Everything was great. We were 6 ppl, we shared 6 different main dishes and the muscles for an appy. Also the fresh baked corn bread. All was amazing. I would go again and again!"
Fable,"I've now been here 3 times and everyrime I come here I'm blown away.  
Last night I went with a friend for dinner and we decided to go to Fable.  
We started with the chickpea fritters and they we really tasty.  But the duck basket was just amazing.  Came with gizzards, necks, and drumettes in a really tasty glaze.  Best appy I've had there by far.  

As for our entrees my friend got the duck breast and that dish is always good Everytime we go.  I decided to try something I don't usually order and let me tell you that the free range chicken I got was epic.  Tender juicy and delish.  I would really like to know how they make chicken that good.  Will be ordering that again.  

As for dessert we shared the lemon meringue parfait.  I don't eat desserts but I will eat that its so good.  

As for service, it's always fantastic.  
Can't wait to go back and eat here again.  

Fable=awesomeness"
Fable,"I really like the food here, very fresh and tasty! But make sure you book in advance, as this place is always full. I had the duck breast as main course and scallop as appetizer, very happy with these choices!"
Fable,"BEST RESTAURANT EVER!! The food is so beautifully done. The staff is super friendly and welcoming! The space is perfect. Fable honestly couldn't be better. 

My favorite dish is the steak fites. Just wait until you try the black pepper jam on the bottom of the plate. I cried. So good. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! AMAZING!"
Fable,"Excellent New Canadian restaurant with incredibly friendly staff. One of the dishes, the Trout, was one of the most simply and yet elegantly presented dishes I've seen in a long time. By the end of the evening we'd been given 2 free drinks each, and ended up having full-on conversations with the manager and all the waitresses and waiters. We had a great time and would highly recommend this spot."
Fable,"Attentive service.  Delicious food.  Fair prices.  Chill vibe.  A new favorite restaurant.  

My boyfriend and I went for dinner with out a reservation and waited about 5 minutes before they were able to accommodate us on a Saturday night.  
Neither of us had been and had no idea that it was a farm to table dining concept and that it had great support and enthusiasm from the staff.  

for dinner we had some local BC oysters to start that were served with unique sided of a grapefruit citrus garnish and horseradish and they were refreshing and great.  For our entrées he ordered the steak and I had the Duck.  Both were super tasty, the steak had a really wonderful pepper flavor and the Duck was perfectly paired with some sweet cabbage.  So satisfied with our meal, we didn't order dessert and just finished off our wine instead.  

We were so impressed by everything we are already talking about going back to try Brunch and Lunch soon.  When we do i'll be sure to write a follow up review."
Fable,"I was taken here for a birthday dinner (mine), by my family as it had been on our collective lists for a while.  I think we knew about it due to Top Chef.

The interior is comfy brick and wood with a chandelier made of pitch forks and shovels to reflect the ""food to table"" theme of the place (thus the name: Fable).  The walls have a variety of interesting artistic decorations (chalk murals, photos of trees etc.)

I really liked our server, she was into the food but not in a pretentious way as can be the case with the farm to table places.  

We had a few tasty appetizers and unlike a certain other similar place (cough, cough,.. Forage), they were generous.  1 item, BBQ chicken drummets, was actually like a meal.  It was a pretty simple dish but the sauce was awesome.

I shared the standard menu item Halibut, though I doubt anything here is ""standard"" since the veggies would all be seasonal. The fish was done perfectly,.., so good.  I'm not a fan of peas so generally avoid them and this dish came with them with no warning but that is my hang-up, not a knock against the tasty array of fiddleheads and other items that accompanies the fish.

The highlight here, surprisingly, was the dessert.  We had a rootbeer macroon which was amazing! It tasted like those bottlecap candies from being a kid.  The Lemon Maringue Parfait was mind blowing: layer after layer of flavour and texture and the Tarragon Ice Cream made it.  Do not come here and not get this, I personally wasn't tempted by the other desserts that I saw.

Everyone in my party mentioned they would come back, as would I, plus there is just something I like about these places popping up on 4th Maenam etc.)"
Fable,"STUNNING

My fiancée and I went here tonight on the strength of other Yelp reviews, and we're so pleased we did! Our server Paul was friendly, informative and efficient, and he helped with a great choice of wine (a lovely Okanagan Grenache). Others have mentioned the chickpea fritters and we reiterate that here, along with the very original 'canned tuna' starter. The duck sausage tortellini were more Asian in feel than Italian, like really light, incredibly tasty dim sum, while the sous-vide 'stiletto' of beef with bok choi and mushrooms was outstanding in texture and flavour, almost gamey. Finally, our fragrant, light lemon meringue parfait was delivered with candle, quite unexpectedly, to mark our anniversary - a sweet touch.

Brilliant food, lovely staff and a relaxed feel - we'll be back!"
Fable,"Fable was recommended to us by a chef friend so we had high expectations. The menu is small (as I expected), but had a lot of variety. They even have a board showing their specials and the prices: great for anyone who hates to ask how much the special costs. Our waitress helped us settle on an appetizer.

We started with the Spaghetti and Meat Ball which is a duck meatball filled with mushroom sauce, the pasta is actually tagliatelle, and it comes with this parmesan foam sauce that disappears as you mix it together. It was really great, but I think next time I'll disregard the advice of mixing it together and try to catch the parmesan foam at full volume.

I had the Gnocchi and Pulled Pork but didn't like the gnocchi -- they were as soft on the inside as mashed potatoes and eating them was a bit disconcerting. I love gnocchi, but they almost felt uncooked. The rest of the dish was great. I liked the pulled pork, but it seemed like a slightly odd pairing: it tasted like traditional BBQ pulled pork and I guess I expected something different.

My wife had the Duck Breast and Legendary Virgin and loved them both.

$70 plus tip"
Fable,"Love this place! Great appies, unique main courses, not to loud and fantastic service! Our server, Esther, was really great, knew the menu well and had some really good suggestions. The Zucchini tagliatelle entree is better than I expected, give it a try if you're looking for something light, tasty and healthy."
Fable,"Very rich and yummy food, but flavours can be a bit lacking. Loved the wine and how fresh everything was; super nice owner as well. Definitely get the fresh bread they have."
Fable,"Nice place to visit.  Staff very good.  I ordered spicy beef ragu with cavatelli. Although it was delicious, it was not out of the ordinary and I wish I had ordered something a bit different.   Also has the chickpea fritters which had a marvellous combinations of flavours."
Fable,"Great service, relaxed atmosphere, and the staff from front to back was happy to help my Celiac self find something I could enjoy without getting sick!

The Black Market salad was wonderful - I loved the combination of sweet figs with cheese, hazelnuts and tart raspberries. The duck was nicely crisped and went beautifully with the beets and apples, and I was really pleasantly surprised with the chocolate panna cotta - at first glance I thought ""that chocolate might be too light for me..."" but combining it with the raspberry reduction popped the flavor perfectly.  I hope to be back!"
Fable,Amazing experience...eggplant parmesean was delicious. Small restaurant....and the portions are small too. Lol. I was going to order dessert but i saw someone else order it and it was small....
Fable,"We went to Fable for the first time last night and it was an excellent experience. The waitstaff were attentive and friendly and the food was incredible. My boyfriend had the free form lasagna and said it was the best meal of his life; I felt similar about my onion gnocchi with chuck. The gnocchi was so fluffy it melted in my mouth. We had the milk buns with orange & black pepper butter to start which were delicious, unique, and a steal for only $4. We will definitely be going back for seconds!

EDIT: I've been back 4 or so times since... consistently incredible food and service. Some of the best meals I've ever had. I recommend the gnocchi, the salmon, the duck breast, the chickpea fritters, and whatever bread of the day is available -- it's always fantastic."
Fable,"Service, food and wine were fantastic. Small place but the staff is passionate about the menu which makes it a must visit."
Fable,"I was dissapointed with Fable maybe because I have heard so many good things about it and had high expectations. 

We went there for brunch on the remembrance day long weekend. The wait was about half an hour.  Cool ambiance,  nice decor.  But we weren't happy with the service. First of all, the server was not familiar with the menu.  She didn't know what the menu ingredients were. She didn't even know if the steak and egg comes with two eggs or one egg. She had to go back to the kitchen and ask all our questions. Finally she ended up sending one of the guys from the kitchen to our table to answer our questions. 
 
Starting with coffee, we ordered an Americano and a regular coffee. I'm not sure if the Americano was really an Americano. The other coffee wasn't hot enough.  

We ordered the Fable eggs and the scrambled eggs. The food was ok, nothing special or too tasty. The scramble and spinach and lardons was served in a mason jar, which made it hard to eat. I like it when restaurants try to be creative and unique, but I think it's important to be practical at the same time. The mason jar idea reminded me of the story of the fox and the stork.  http://www.story.net.in/2013/07/the-fox-and-stork-moral-stories.html?m=1

We also ordered a side of the rosti and I asked the server to have the chives cream on the side instead of the top of the rosti (for dietary reasons) but it came with the creme on top.

Anyway, the food was mediocre - nothing really special. I think Fable is one of those restaurants who base their reputation  on the "" farm to the table"" philosophy rather than focusing on the taste of the food and the quality of the service.

All said, I would go back there for dinner before making my final judgement."
Fable,"STOP!

Stop scrolling through reviews.
Stop flipping through tips and highlights.
Give me your full attention for 10 seconds folks. 
Even if you don't read the rest of the review, take this tidbit to heart and carry on:

Lemon Meringue Parfait.
Order it.

This dessert is my spirit animal.
A mythically fabulous concoction of fantastic feasting.
It is the Unicorn of desserts.
And it's f&*king fantastic.

Now not many dishes make me cuss. But this combination of meringue, tarragon icecream and lemon goodness was one of those desserts that is so good, you realize half way through you've been unintentionally making some fairly inappropriate sounds whilst eating.

I would like a giant version of this, so I could Diva Von Tease the heck out of it. Giant martini glass be damned. 

And I dare say, this little number just hopped into my top spot on desserts in the city. Yes, even beating out Pidgin's fried chocolate fabulousness and the Acorn's dark chocolate cherry ganache. It's really, really good.

Just order it.

.... ok, you may continue on.
But if you're sticking around, this is what else went down at dinner:

Starters:
Chickpea fritters - was expecting ""fries"". Maybe i've been spending too much time at Storm Crow. But I was pleasantly surprised by these hearty little balls (snicker). It's nice that they have full chickpeas and the garnishes are great. Nice portion size. Would recommend.

Oysters - so long as they are fresh and shucked properly, can you really f'up an oyster? Either way, these were lovely.

Spagetti & Meat Balls - so there's not multiple balls. It's one ball. But it's a good ball. I'm not sure if i'd order this again as a starter. It's a pretty hefty portion for a first course and quite heavy. Pasta cooked well. Duck ball was tasty. Not mind-blowingly so, but i'd order it again.

Mains:
Salmon - except they were sold out of the salmon so we subbed for halibut with all the salmon sides (dining with a veggie). The cassoulet was the stand out on this dish BY FAR. Light and earthy dish all around. Would order again when looking for a lighter dinner.

Gnocchi - with peas, pesto, pea puree, pea shoots & mushrooms. I would actually pass on this one next time. But I think I ruined it for myself by declaring my love for Acorn's Gnocchi immediately before it hit the table. Tasty, but there were better things in the mix. Those mushrooms however? Mmmmm

Drinks: 
Oaken Gin Old Fashioned - order it.
Lavender Spritzer - pass. I have to stop ordering girly drinks. Just not a lot of interesting going on with this one. Would be nice for brunch.
Of everything we had tonight, the cocktails were the only thing slightly lacking. Besides the old fashioned, nothing much else jumped out at me.
And give a girl a scotch cocktail would ya?

Desserts:
Lemon Meringue Parfait -  I'm in love.

Gorgonzola Cheesecake - close second. Rich but not too heavy. Super fresh berries.

Blueberry Lavender Tart - for those seeking a more traditional dessert. Not my favourite, but would be nice with tea. Didn't get much lavender off this one though.

Sweet Bites - we had chocolate macarons. They were pretty tasty. But there are SO many people doing macarons now, it's hard to stand out. Safe bet.

Lemon Meringue Parfait -  I'm so in love i'm mentioning it again.

Service: Ninja status.

Overall: Get this lady a strong, balanced scotch based cocktail and you'll never be rid of me. Total fan."
Fable,"No need to go any further. Just go. Seriously, stop reading, and get there already. Why are you still here? Fine...

Prices: For gourmet food? It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. 

Service: As good as Bill Murray's funny. 

Food: You know the best day in your life? You can multiply that by infinity, and add one. You can seriously order any main dish, and you'll be a happy camper. Seriously, I can't say enough good things. It's like hot sex in your mouth.     

Recommendations: You must order the Lemon Meringue Parfait, or you're an asshole."
Fable,"I ate here with my family who were visiting from Ireland. We all shared our appies: ""Tuna Can"" 2/5
""Spagetti & Meatballs"" 4/5
""Strawberry Salad"" 4/5
""Chickpea Fritters"" AMAZING! 5/5
""Chicken Wings""(on special) BEST WINGS! 5/5

for our mains we had:
""Steak Frites"" 5/5
""Gnocci"" 5/5 FLAVOUR TOWN!
""Steelhead Trout"" 5/5 fish was like butter!
 
we tried every desert and they were all AMAZING!

5 appies, 5 mains, 5 deserts, 5 cocktails, Bottle of wine = $350 

Service was the best I have received in Vancouver! 

Overall: Fantastic Flavours, Well worth it!"
Fable,"Pretty good food, but a bit pricey for what you get. Flat iron steak was excellent but my wife's $27.00 pasta special had only 3 mussels. Wine selection is limited and if you're looking for a reasonably priced bottle, you'll need to go elsewhere. Lemon meringue parfait was excellent. Service was excellent and knowledgeable staff made it a worthwhile evening."
Fable,"Congratulations Trevor Bird and friends! Fable really lived up to the hype for us. It was nice to see the whole team working together and really putting their money where their mouth is :) 

Service is top notch. All I can say about that.

1 star off because our version of the famed canned tuna was extremely fishy. Like kinda grossed us out. And yes, we are sashimi people. I'm sure we just got a bad batch ;) 

Also my steelhead was really undercooked for me...I like it on the lighter cooked side, but this was bordering raw, which wasn't appropriate for this particular dish. (Perhaps, my taste buds were a bit sensitive after the fishy fishy tuna!) 

Everything else....chickpea fritters, duck, libations all superb.

Our table sucked (it was the first table directly in line with the front door and I was freeeeezing the whole dinner from the draft pulling through). But that's Vancouver dining for you, I guess? 

I ordered a boozy hot apple cider (yum!) to counteract the chill. It helped, but would have helped even more if it was on the house, since it was pretty obvious I was ""suffering""  ;) Thanks yelp, for letting me reach my cheeky quota of the day! 

Anyways, go to fable. Just keep in mind the vibe is bistro not fine dining (the value driven menu thoughtfully reflects that fact) and you will be happy :)"
Fable,"Wow, really, extraordinary food and off the charts wine list, who knew they had a verdejo/albariño grapes wine in BC? they are genuinely nice also...so our first impression wasn't correct and I'm happy to say!"
Fable,"My lovely friend took me out to Fable for my birthday.  We were told that we couldn't make reservations so we went at 7pm to get a first come first served table.  Actually, we were seated quite quickly.  So that's good.

Food was very interestingly good, especially the canned tuna (taretare?), the chick pea frits was slightly dry but I still liked it, and the trout was juicy with my favourite kale on the side.

It would have been 4 stars but we were asked to move to another table near the end of our meal.  It really disrupted us.  The server should have told us from the beginning that our table was only available until 8:30pm so at least we knew.  It was awkward having to get up, move everything to another table, and get seated again.  The most awkward part was we got another server who had NO idea what's happening and offered us water again with menus... we asked for the bill instead because we were pretty much done eating by then.  AWKWARD.  Feel sorry for the second server, she didn't get the tips but she did try to give us good service and had to clear our table after we left.  Oh well."
Fable,"Had Brunch
1. Benedicts with Olive Oil Hollandaise with Ham
- I want to try smoked salmon one next time. Would be better in my opinion, but was still very nice
2. Scrambled Eggs: Fable brioche, potato
- I loved it, but others were not so excited with this dish.
3. Steak and Eggs: potato, rustic bread
- Steak - yes, Eggs - yes (what can go wrong with steak and eggs?)
4. Pulled Pork Johnny Cakes
- Not my favourite, but was still pretty interesting idea to have pulled pork with pancakes"
Fable,"I've heard a lot about Fable and was told by numerous people that I had to get my butt in there. Finally had the chance when I had family coming in to visit from Sacramento so we made our way there for dinner on a Tuesday and I was kind of but not really surprised at how busy it was. One of the people in our party has a lot of allergies (milk & nuts) so our server was awesome with describing every dish and which ones to stay away from. Also got the chef to make sure some things were left off the plate completely. Our table of 4.5 (1 kid), we shared 3 appies and 3 entrees and were pretty stuffed by the end. We ordered the chickpea fritters, best ""canned tuna"" (MUST GET)  and the spaghetti and meatballs for appies. For entrees we got the salmon, butcher's cut (to die for) and the roasted duck breast. The price added up pretty quickly but this is one of those places where it's quality over quantity and the quality was top notch."
Fable,"Oh my. GAWWD! 
My bestie and I went for brunch and shared the farmers muffin and the French toast and a side of Bacon (which is a small slab of pork belly). At first when the plates came out we were disappointed by the portion size but completely forgot about it once we started eating. The muffin: The pepper jam blew my mind, the potatos were perfectly crisp and seasoned, the house made sausage was moist and had a great texture and it was the perfect complement to our next course, which was the French toast. 
What?!! Where have you been all my life? I've never had French toast like that! I'm more of a waffle girl, but man oh man, it was delicious. Made with a huge hunk of brioche, it was lightly battered with egg so it wasn't grossly soaked through and soggy. In fact, it was just on this side of perfect. It was topped with berries and whipped ecstasy with a smear of Apple sauce. I didn't need any maple syrup, but that's a personal preference.
The atmosphere is a bit loud but the decor is cool and and food is amazing. 
The price point is affordable in regards to your pocket book but is an absolute steal in regards to the quality.  I can't wait to come back for dinner!"
Fable,"This has got to be one of the best brunches I've had in a long time.  While their brunch menu is not extensive, what they do have are made to perfection.  I sampled their pulled pork Johnny cakes (really pancakes) and their Fable eggs with lardons (cubed bacon) and their rustic bread.  The way they put their ingredients together were superb.  While the Johnny cakes came with syrup on the side, I didn't need it.  The pulled pork has just enough sweetness added to it to create a nice juxtaposition to the saltiness of the pork.  Great job.  

I should also comment that the service I received was exemplary.  The staff were constantly refilling my coffee and water.  One time my coffee was sitting there for a while.  When I asked for a warmup, the waitress instead went and got me a brand new cup of coffee.  Big brownie points for that.

Because this place is so popular, expect to have long waits if you go during the busy periods as they don't take reservations for brunch.  It also gets a bit noisy due to the number of people stuffed into the moderately sized restaurant...but it does add to the level of energy of the place.

This is not one of those places where you go to for brunch to stuff yourself with a lot of greasy filling food.  It's a place where you leave with a satisfied feel in your stomach and very happy taste buds."
Fable,"Oh well, you wanna try one of the best in Vancouver, go to Fable. When it comes to restaurants I don't care much about the organic/farm/health based foods since sometimes these concepts makes the taste slightly blurry (I know it shouldn't be). This place made it far extreme. They serve you very delicious French/Italian style dishes. 

They service is very efficient and friendly. They always have their smiles and you feel that they take care of you not because they expect tips but because they want you to be happy and enjoy. The foods are not cheap but definitely worth visiting the place.

I rarely rate a restaurant 5/5 but these guys earned it. I loved their rabbit and duck breast.  Note also that it's very difficult to impress me with a good pasta dish since I have lived in Italy for long and I've had the best pasta dishes all over there. But, these guys made it ;)"
Fable,Food is good. But there is not enough of it for the price. Service is okay-not excellent.
Fable,"Great place for brunch. My BF and I shared the steak and eggs, and we also ordered a side of house made sausage. The black pepper jam was super tasty, and it just about tasted great with everything. The portion of the steak and eggs was kind of small, but it was pretty delicious."
Fable,"Starters recommended by waitress included corn bread, chickpea fritters, and octopus salad. The fritters were dressed up burnt falafels with greens and spicy chipotle type sauce. Cornbread was ok. The octopus was inedible and bitter tasting and the four people at out table all downed their cutlery with one bite. We were all left with bad tastes in our mouths. We sent back the octopus. Our waitress was the bearer of a message from the chef for us. He said to tell us that he tasted the octopus and ""it was up to his standards but they would take it off the bill"", Our waitress made some comment about us not being used to the taste of octopus - so the impression we got was ""what would we know""?. I have eaten octopus from BC to Italy, France, Greece and Mexico and it never tasted bad like that. It was off! Our main courses included the special flank steak and the gnocchi and these were good. However, the brown smear of blackcurrant jam under the beef did not add to a pleasing presentation. Desserts were a disappointment - custard with rhubarb pudding was custard with uncooked raw rhubarb which was cold, tough and chewy. The deconstructed chocolate creme brûlée was in fact a smear of melted chocolate on a plate sprinkled with vegan salty bacon bits, burnt oreo crumbs, salt, and pepper - yuck. The cheapest bottle of Sauvignon Blanc was $62. I will not be returning."
Fable,Fantastic food. Yummy yummy in my tummy! The best part is that the server will go great lengths to explain the food to you. Please don't interrupt him/her when they are in the process of doing so. :)
Fable,"Foodz:

** Chickpea Fritters - the curry mayo. Oh wow.
** Beet Salad - Very bright and fresh. Could have used a touch more salt.
** Spaghetti and Meatballs - Can I haz a bowl of just the meatballs and parm foam? plz?
** Tomato Soup - Did I spy a grilled cheese crouton in the middle of that bowl of warmth and cozy? Yes.
** Halibut - Of course, the dish I order is the one I'm least fond of. Loved the concept of this dish and the fish was nicely poached, but the onions in the chowder were still slightly raw and overpowered the mussels. Also, the chowder was actually luke warm, which overall ruined the dish. The fried bit at the top was the only bit of texture and it needed more. Boo.

** Milk-poached chicken - loved the bit of fried chicken with that. Yum.
** Duck Breast - This was a delicious dish as well and the duck was cooked very nicely.
** Lemon Meringue parfait - Holy Hell. Come here for this dessert. The tarragon ice cream is bananas! The lemon is delicious. It's magic.

Yeah, we ordered the menu. And yes, for the most part, it was all amazingly delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. I will be back for boozy brunch."
Fable,I had the asparagus salad and the smoked duck breast for dinner. This was a nice and simple farm-to-table meal. The food and service were good and the décor of the restaurant is very simple.
Fable,I love Fable. It's great comfort food with a twist. Best tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich in town.
Fable,"Came here with my cousins for a family meal, and all in all was a great experience.  One of the top places in Vancouver in my opinion.  Lots of variety.  We got a variety of dishes including the gnocchi, hanger steak, and sea bass.  All were very well thought out.  Don't skip the famous tuna!"
Fable,My brother from Ontario & I had an awesome breakfast here. We both enjoyed our meals and the service was top notch! Will definitely go again!
Fable,"After my last review, Fable sent me a gift certificate to come back and give them another try. For the past couple of months, I've randomly tried to make reservations (which turns out to be just shy of impossible) and shown up at 5:30pm for dinner (really early, or so I thought) to be told that they didn't have any room for the rest of the evening. Not ""oh we have an hour wait"" but literally no room for the rest of the evening! This place is obviously very popular!

Long story short, I called yesterday and somehow managed to get a reservation for two to celebrate my birthday with my mother. So here's my update...

We arrived and the only thing we were greeted with was ""Hi"" from the hostess who acted as if we had interrupted her in the middle of something. Maybe I'm just being picky, but a more friendly greeting would have been nice as it felt like I had to request to be seated rather than being offered. It was a pretty awkward way to start off my Fable experience. OK, maybe I am just being picky, moving on...

As I noticed during my original visit, the decor is really charming, love the open kitchen and the whole notion of farm-to-table really fits well with my values. The menu changes seasonally, which I really appreciate, to use fresh, local ingredients. All things I can really support, yay!

The server seemed almost kind of nervous, I'm not sure if it was her first time or first week or something. But she'd obviously forgotten the feature entree and ran off to go double-check and come back to tell us. After a quick look at the menu, it was clear what we both wanted: chickpea fritters, steak frites and ""P"" gnocchi with pork belly, and lots of water to wash it all down.

The chickpea fritters were the star of the meal! They were so flavourful, all of the ingredients balanced each other out so well and my mum and I just could not get enough! I would have liked those fritters as my main course. 

The steak frites came Medium, just as was ordered, and was really tasty - my mum really enjoyed it.

I got the ""P"" gnocchi with the pork belly. It was very flavourful, the homemade gnocchi was delicious and all of the flavours were well represented. I did find that when I was finishing my plate I had a lot more gnocchi than pea shoots/pea puree/ricotta/tomatoes so I would have liked some more balance between the pasta and the other ingredients. 

There was another little mix-up with our bill. The server seemed really thrown when we gave her the gift certificate, but managed to calculate our bill by hand with a calculator. However, we brought back our change in larger bills. So we didn't have ANY cash to leave for a tip. We asked for smaller change, she said she'd find some but never came back. Went up to the cashier to ask again, she said she was still trying to find some. 20 minutes since receiving our bill and paying it, we gave up and left. What restaurant doesn't have a till full of change at 5:30pm on a Monday? Why does it take 20 minutes to pay your bill and try to tip your server? Why did we have to chase staff down to pay at a restaurant? 

Overall, the food was delicious and if I was reviewing just the food this place would get 5 stars. However, even this visit the front-of-house staff seemed really awkward about bills, using the tills and greeting at the door. The service is just not what I expect when I'm paying for dinner at the same price point as restuarants like Lupo and Seasons in the Park. Those are restaurants that provide the exceptional service you expect when splurging on a nice dinner out at a ""higher end"" restaurant. Fable, for the same price point, just seems lacking in that department. For the money spent at a place like this, you really expect the whole package and the 'experience' of dining at a nice restaurant.

Not sure I will be returning any time soon... sorry Fable."
Fable,"I went here for brunch, and it was delicious. I don't know what kind of black magic they use on their eggs, but they were the best eggs I've ever tasted. There is a big lineup to come in, and no wonder. The food is awesome, the ambiance is super pleasant, and the staff is great. The one thing that bothered me was that sometimes they were a bit too eager and there was more than one person asking us if we needed anything. I swear at one point within a span of 5 minutes our coffee got refilled 3 times by three different people. Many a punchline was ruined and conversation interrupted. Maybe having just one person serving a table would work better. In any case, I'd definitely come back to try their lunch and dinner menu. Probably the best brunch I've had in Vancouver, and I've had many."
Fable,Wow expensive lunch here. A salad costs $17. the food here was good and tasty. but i wouldnt come here again since there are many other options in this area.
Fable,"For a full review click on the link here:

Fable,"We have eaten here several times. The food is amazing. That said, we can't figure out which is better, the food or the service. The front of house staff made each experience at Fable truly memorable. Can't wait for our next opportunity to go back."
Fable,"We had another excellent meal at Fable for our anniversary. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgable about the food and was able to answer all our questions. For appetizers, we had the bread and stuffed zucchini blossoms, both of which were on special. They were excellent! We also had the duck meatball with Parmesan foam. It was to die for! Definitely a must. For mains we had the steak and pork...both excellent. We were too full after the above for dessert...next time! I can't wait to come for brunch....hopefully sometime in the near future!"
Fable,"I have driven past the place I don't know how many times but finally made my way inside. I am kicking myself that I haven't been sooner. The food was solid, we shared the egg scramble and the oatmeal but the service was exceptional. You can see that everyone has been trained to spot empty cups, dirty plates and help with any questions promptly and graciously. Definitely a new regular brunch spot!"
Fable,"Awesome place for loca-vores craving something fresh and a bit unique. Very laid back, rustic atmosphere perfect for the concept and the neighbourhood.

I had the halibut with polenta and chorizo bouillabaisse. My server very helpfully informed me that the parsley crust that is supposed to coat the halibut contained flour as a binder, but she was able to make the meal gluten free by eliminating the crust and sautéing the fish with lemon, salt and pepper instead. Everything was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. We shared the gorgonzola cheesecake with pickled strawberries for dessert because it was the only gluten free dessert option. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake and the gorgonzola taste was a bit strong for me in the context of a dessert, but I really enjoyed the pickled strawberries. It would be nice if they added additional GF dessert options. The service was excellent and cocktails we tried were also wonderful.

Excellent food and service and definitely worth a return visit."
Fable,"I went for lunch and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was fresh and light and they seem to understand that a lot of people prefer meat and veg these days to carbs and grains. A restaurant that can plan for and accommodate this is simply doing their job as a leader in food and hospitality. 

The black mission figs was a brilliant way to start the meal. Light, thoughtful additions, and aesthetically pleasing. 

I had the duck confit salad, which - as I suspected - was incredible. My date had the grilled cheese as to which I cannot comment on but she ate the whole thing. I also ordered a side of pulled pork for her sandwich. Admittedly, they could work on their BBQ sauce. Tasted more like the top of my Mom's old meatloaf (which isn't bad at all) and less like a proper southern BBQ sauce. 

Good times, Fable. Got the second date!"
Fable,"Booked an open table reservation for 5pm.  Arrived at 4:53pm with my 90+ grandmother who visibly struggles to walk even with human help and cane.  The restaurant said they were not open yet and could not allow us go in.  I asked if we could enter and just allow her to sit down and the restaurant employee said no.   Another pedestrian who happened to walked by and ask us, ""did they really just do that? wow that is terrible.""  

I am giving two stars because when we did enter later after waiting outside for 8 minutes the experience was very good.

We were invited to go again and the service and food were great.  They were very accommodating to both a picky eater and a foodie. Thank you!"
Fable,"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Menu changes but I've gotten the duck, the steak frites, and a pork chop special on separate occasions and I've loved it every time.

The ""canned tuna"" with albacore tuna, lemon and fingerling potatoes cooked in a small mason jar sous-vide and served with crostinis is to die for. Must try!"
Fable,One of the best french toasts I've ever tried. We sat at the bar and got to watch all of the action!
Fable,Super interesting and lovely. Veeeery pricey though
Fable,"Delicious food. Creative dishes. Friendly service. We had a beef special of the day, the duck, the gnocchi, and the sausage wrapped pork. Decent serving sizes so we didn't need the appetizers or dessert. Mixed drinks were weak, beer was good. We went to the ice cream place down the block for dessert."
Fable,"Lucked out for Sunday brunch in that we just missed the big line up!

Food was very well done and the special Caesar was pretty good too. Not sure it was worth the $12 price though.

For a very busy place our food came out in a timely manner and we never felt forgotten by our server. Plus there was not too much noise from other tables which made conversing that much better."
Fable,This place is fantastic! The mussels were phenomenal. The duck meatball was very rich and delicious. Had the stiletto beef special and heirloom salad both were delicious. The server Claude made the experience even better! Will be back and highly recommend!
Fable,"Great location....started with corn bread and the butter....fantastic start then on to roasted duck that was fab 
My wife had the lamb and it was brilliant 
We had our daughter with us who was misbehaving but the staff came through to help entertain. They supplied colouring books and toys and really made our visit enjoyable. 
I love places like this with great food and great service and staff and really great ambiance. 
A very creative menu with distinct and enjoyable flavours. 

We will return"
Fable,"Love this restaurant. Food is amazing, simple menu changes often but you can always be sure that whatever they offer is going to be delicious. Great wine list with even better prices, something for everyone. Staff is friendly and definitely passionate about food, you can tell they love working there. Dinner and brunch are both excellent. Highly recommend!!"
Fable,"Foodies and Food Network geeks will love it here.  The menu, service and even atmosphere cater to passionate food lovers.  The entire service team is helpful, appearing to take pleasure in explaining each plate and welcoming any and all questions thrown their way.  Fable is made for people who live to eat.    

The menu is not a radical departure from typical west coast Canadiana, but there are enough twists, playful flavour combinations and textures to keep an eater interested through every bite. The beef tartare comes liberally dressed in a sour cream based sauce - a fun play on the much loved sour cream and onion chip when paired with the house fried potatoes chips.  The oysters with pickled horse radish and citrus segments were phenomenal and the stand out dish of the night, followed closely by the gorgonzola cheesecake to end the evening.  The print menu is interesting and I'm sure would not disappoint, but ordering off the chalk board, updated very regularly I am told, is where it is at.      
 
At times the playful food geek side of Chef Trevor Bird overpowers the simplicity of the farm table menu, but the passion and creativity he brings shines through making for consistently interesting and exciting plates.  Every bite is unique, both in flavour and texture - it is a real pleasure eating at Fable.    

Sure everyone may be doing farm to table food these days, but Fable does it very well.   If eating is your thing, go to Fable and enjoy."
Fable,Fantastic brunch and the best service I've had in Vancouver in years. Keep it up!
Fable,"TL;DR: Get the Duck Breast, the Risotto and the Chickpea Fritters 

This place was recommended to me by a server at Heirloom. He told me he helped conceptualize Acorn, Heirloom and Fable (from the Farm to the Table) and that it was a MUST try. So I gathered a bunch of my girlfriends and we gave it a try. I've been back twice since.

Of course before going, I looked it up on yelp to see what type of reviews they were getting and I was impressed.

The duck seemed to be the star here and having never had it before that's what I got. Since there was a few of us around the table we ordered many items and shared. My thoughts:

1. Chickpea Fritters: Amazing and well dressed. I just wish there was more on the plate.
2. Canned Tuna: Perfect size, not the best for sharing because you'll want to lick it out of the jar
3. Beet salad: nothing to write home about
4. Pumpkin Risotto: Creamy, flavorful, generous portion
5. Duck Breast: Like I said, it was my first time eating duck, and now, thanks to Fable, I am hooked. It was both crispy and tender and it just melted in my mouth. It came with some silky, braised red cabbage, tender parsnip and a perfectly crunchy duck confit croquette. 

The duck and the Risotto were the highlight of my night (every time I went). I loved this place enough to want to try their lunch and their weekend brunch.

Last but not least, a HUGE ++ for me: They take reservations!!"
Fable,"Had great service here, but the food did not meet expectations.  The special braised beef was delicious but a bit over cooked The salmon was tasteless, had no sauce and was undercooked and translucent. The dish promised humus, but when the food came it was mustard humus, not a fan. The fingerling potatoes were undercooked as well.  Plain noodles for $8. for our child were very limp and smashed together, not al dente at all as requested."
Fable,"Hands down one of my favorite breakfasts places to come to while in Vancouver.
Food is always fresh and staff are friendly.  Eggs Benedict are awesome"
Fable,"Fable is tucked in the middle of the street and you can easily miss the discreet entrance if you aren't looking. I came on a Monday and the place was packed at 8 o'clock, reservations are definitely a must.

We had the feature deep fried duck platter that included the neck, gizzard and legs. The portion was really huge and was well worth the $10 price. However, the dish was a bit greasy and was not crispy enough for me. Our main course included the duck breast and the steak frites. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and the accompany sauce for each dish was a great match. For dessert we had the s'mores, a modern take on the camping classic. Not too sweet and the addition of the ice cream is a nice contrast to the warm marshmallow."
Fable,"Had the special bread of the day - cornbread with cinnamon butter.  Omg, so good. Would go back just for that. Cocktails and the salmon I had, also great!"
Fable,"Fable was fabulous. Everything Tuc aspires, and fails, to be. 

The day's focaccia with garlic butter was a marvel of texture, salt, sweet. 

The smoked duck was remarkable--pea mash, mint, creme fraiche, pickled shallot.  A great symphony; the whole very much more than the sum of its parts. Only thing I wasn't totally clear on was the gnocchi, which did not seem to have much in the dish to support their blank canvas. 

The lamb sausage and halibut, in an unexpected but wonderful tomato based sauce with fennel. Spicy, rich, light--many goals balanced in one. 

The server suggested excellent wine pairings. 

The dessert (lemon meringue earl grey ice cream parfait)--surprisingly the meringue was lemon as well; the lemon curd was perfect; the ice cream was not particularly noticeable as earl grey--but the crumble crust insight delightful."
Fable,"Duck was delicious
Chorizo muscles were exceptional 
Tuna in a can was good - although not as good as expected
Steak frites delicious
Pork loin ok
Decor and atmosphere are lovely
Chandelier unique 
Service very friendly and prompt"
Fable,"One sunny day in the city, a husband said to his wife, let's go out for a nice breakfast. So nice, we'll call it brunch. They had heard of a place called Fable in the enchanted village of Kitsilano. Fable was known for its mystical ways with the local bounty of the land, so they traversed the city to reach its door. 

The first thing they noticed was the kitchen, as it is not hidden away, but right up at the front, where everyone can see the chefs working their magic. Here too was a tall shelf filled with mason jars containing preserves and jams. Beyond the door was the dining room, filled with happy-looking people dressed in the local costumes of fleece and flannel and curiously large glasses. And lo and behold, a table for two awaited. 

Because it is taboo to both order the same thing at a restaurant, the husband chose the french toast and the wife, scrambled eggs with wilted spinach and bacon. The french toast had blueberries and syrup, and when he offered her a bite, she said it tasted like a muffin and a pancake had lived happily ever after. She scooped up the fluffy eggs and their Parmesan foam topping from the wee mason jar it was served in, saving a bit of brioche to soak up the juices - that which she did not slather with the wild blueberry-bay leaf jam. The server smiled indulgently as she brought around frequent coffee refills, and with the check, complimentary fresh house-made cookies with white chocolate and raisins.

They were very, very full and walked very, very slowly, admiring the delights of the village, such as the community gardens just a block away, and remembering the warmth of Fable and all who worked there. If there is a lesson here, it is eat well and be happy."
Fable,"Came here for lunch. Had a cocktail named something something rose, it was great!
Had beef burger and fish burger, both taste great! The daily special chicken wings are amazing with the sweet and sour taste.
The tomato soup was too heavy though...
Gonna come back and try their dinner sometime."
Fable,Love this place. Very friendly staff and great food. Try a an appetizer - we loved the pasta.
Fable,"Cute find! I've heard great things about Fable and was dying to go! Went there for dinner and I was told how great their canned tuna was, so decided to have that as a starter. Unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan. It had strong fishy after taste for me. 

For entree I order steak & fritters - who can go wrong with that? Steak was moist and delish! Found fries a little salty but was good as well. Friend order their special - can't remember name, but was a rabbit dish. As much as I wanted to try the dish. I couldn't. It seemed to have a lot going on but friend very much enjoyed the dish. Portions were generous. Price I found reasonable for restaurants around 4th ave.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant. Wasn't able to try the famous lemon merengue as we were too full but am definitely going back to try! :)"
Fable,"Easily my favourite restaurant in Vancouver. Exceptional service, delicious menu and a real homey feeling that pairs perfectly with the style of cuisine. 

Could not recommend Fable any higher. No wonder it is so well reviewed.

5 Stars"
Fable,Ate here March 2016. It was excellent.  We had the special of hamachi kama do-it-yourself lettuce wraps with pickles and kimchi and yummy sauce.  Entree was octopus on fava puree with radishes. All was amazing and exciting and fun. I even asked for a cocktail I made up while I was sitting there thinking and they made it for me!  Don't miss Fable (make a reservation- we got lucky!) if you want to really enjoy something different.
Fable,"Three for three Fable! 
I've had the pleasure of two amazing feasts at Fable this summer and one helluva good hangover brunch as well. 
Absolutely perfectly executed every time.

I have nothing genius to write here. Just that I hope this is the new standard for Vancouver restaurants. I like seeing the kitchen up close with all the action literally at your fingertips. It says a lot about Fable that they are willing to pretty much show their guests anything and everything to do with how they prepare your meals. 
It takes a lot of confidence to allow this kind of access. And they pull it off seamlessly. 

Keep it up Fable. You rock.

Oh, and thanks for bailing me outta that hangover a couple weeks back.
Curse you open -bar weddings!"
Fable,Epic brunch!  The johnny cakes with pulled pork were stunningly good and the daily special donut was the best donut I've ever had -- and I've had my share!
Fable,"Fantastic meal while in Vancouver to catch a cruise.  Cozy and not too loud.  The waitress was amazing.  I wish I remembered her name.  She was attentive but we never felt rushed.  Everything we ate was delicious.  The wine recommendations (all local) were perfect matches.  They even helped the stupid tourists figure out how to get a taxi back to our hotel!  I wish this place was in NYC, I'd be there every night."
Fable,"The service was exceptional, the price reasonable. To be honest, it's all about service service, service. It's refreshing to find a place which does well in that department. 

One of our daughter had the big kids' breakfast and she had a thick cutter bacon...not fair!  we ordered the chocolate glazed donut as well which was a highlight. Steak and eggs were cooked well and the breakfast smoothie is something you should try. 

The food was wonderful, it's not at the point of exquisite but it's very nice. Worth coming."
Fable,"The milkshakes are a must at Fable Diner!! They're a large portion, so it can be fun to just pop over for these. Food is always great here, highly recommend this restaurant."
Fable,One of the restaurants in Vancouver that I will miss now that I no longer live in the area
Fable,"great service, nice food, and unique flavour. I like the corn bread and Pulled pork gnocchi. Compare with flying pig in down town, food is more fun and interesting."
Fable,"This restaurant should be a lesson to all restauranteurs out there. The service is amazing, their commitment to quality food is unbelievable. When one of our apps went back only half eaten they took notice and without us even asking they offered to comp it due to it being undercooked. I've been to restaurants before where if you aren't satisfied with your meal they'll comp it, but never have I been to a restaurant where they keep an eye on how much food is left on the plate. Outstanding! The chef and staff really want you to have the best dining experience they can offer and they deliver. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the drinks while tasty are weak and pricey for said weakness. Their desserts also leave a bit to be improved upon. We ordered three and they were either too sweet or not sweet enough. An addition of a dessert specialist to their staff may be in order. 

A quick breakdown of our meal... The halibut was incredible. The short rib special was outstanding. The duck liver pate app was delicious. Drinks were tasty but ""light."" Desserts were sweet and not so sweet. 

So in summary, their chefs know how to cook kick ass meals, their staff should be teaching everyone in Vancouver how to run a restaurant and if you go to Fable you will have one of the best dining experiences that are offered in Vancouver. I'd put them up next to Forage and Bishops. That's how good they are."
Fable,"Food: 4.5 - Everyone greatly enjoyed their meal, thought a few dishes could have had a bit more ""punch"" to them, but beautifully arranged and fairly priced.
Service: 3.5 - Service was prompt and always there when needed but not overbearing. However certainly don't love the skate shoes, flannel and jeans our server was wearing. Don't usually care for the attire, but when you dress like you're rolling out of bed to go to a 711, it shows a lack of care or respect for your clientele. Absolutely no different then how you plate food. You wouldn't expect them to slop food on the plate, why should the service staff get away with looking like that.
Room: 2.5 - Very very cramped & hot space. I know that's what most of Vancouver is these days, but I don't have to like being treated like I'm being shoved into a room with as many bodies as they can possibly fit."
Fable,"One of my favourite places to eat in Vancouver.

Food & ambience are great.  Service variable, sometimes excellent, sometimes a little bit aloof, but always polite.

Make sure you book in advance for evening dinner and be prepared to line up for weekend brunch.

We enjoyed the spaghetti & meatballs (well should meatball, singular as it's one tasty moist duck meatball), roast chicken, duck breast, and the mussles.

There are sometime great finds on the daily specials board, like roast pork to share family style.

The desserts are ok.  Taste good but nothing special.

Sitting at the bar next to kitchen can be quite fun, watching the chefs prepare the food during a busy service.

If they changed up the menu more frequently I'd eat here even more often.

Highly recommended!"
Fable,"If this place was any more farm-to-table you'd be walking through bullsh#t...from the most innovative cocktails (alcoholic and non-), an extensive BC wine list,  a menu just big enough but laden with creativity and goodness and all the staff were so helpful,  knowledgeable,  and friendly and it was easy to be paleo here. Nice bar out front,  great mix of patrons.  Without doubt one of the best meals we've  ever had."
Fable,"Delicious food and amazing service always! 

This place can get super busy so make sure to get there early or make reservations well in advance! Yummmmmmy! I've been here at least 20 times and never ever get sick of it as they always have new lunch and dinner meals, however I have my faves indeed. The flat iron steak and the canned tuna. Mouth watering! 

Also makes me feel special that my server always remembers me even after long visits in between! 

Keep it up team Fable! You guys rock!"
Fable,Great weekend brunch and dinner.  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and attentive.
Fable,"Fable to me kind of suffers a problem for portion size and flavor complexity.

[canned tuna]
The canned tuna is something they pitch where it comes in a mason jar.  It's good.

[gnocchi]
The gnocchi is pretty fresh, but as a meal, I find it hard to recommend it to stand alone.  It just seems kind of odd to eat just eat potato type dumplings for a meal.

[potato crusted chicken]
A good dish.

[overall]
I just kind of think Fable doesn't give enough food for their portions.  To me if you are going to do small portions like fancy food, they up your flavor complexity with more layers and depth.

The food is okay and good.  But not great, and not bad.  Just A-OK as Yelp says I suppose."
Fable,"I came here with five friends while on a long-weekend, getaway vacation. I did some research and Fable sounded good. Well, I'm happy to say it exceeded all expectations! Above all, the food was outstanding. Starting with the bread - not simply a couple of rolls placed on the table - but rather awesome, freshly baked, sourdough bread. From there, everything continued to delight. Especially the gnocchi! Also, it was National Caesar Day and Fable's are sooo good. The service was exceptional too and the atmosphere, great. Bottom line, if I'm ever back in Vancouver, I'm coming back to this restaurant."
Fable,"Fable stands for Farm to Table and their name is truly reflective of their values. I first encountered Fable in a google search when looking for ways to commit to eating ethically sourced meats. I contacted Fable to ask them where they purchased their products from and I was blown away by the amount of information they provided me with. These guys are truly commited to buying the most ethical of meats. This was the response I recieved from their awesome team: 

""We are the restaurant for you, as that is EXACTLY what we are all about!  We get much of our meat from Two Rivers since they are very transparent about the source of their animals and we know the farms that they source from, who treat their animals well, and have welcomed us to inspect their facilities. 
Most of our pigs we get from Walter, and we know them down to their names.  We still keep our first pig's skull on top of our preserve cabinet - Ralph. (sorry if that is too morbid). 
I am glad you asked, where we get our meat and produce from is at the heart of our farm to table concept.  Our veggies and greens are also local.  Trevor was instramental in helping Local Garden get going, that allows us to keep it local and natural. ""

Beyond the ethical component, the food is exceptional and they are always offering uo great daily specials. The service has always been great and the room includes some very cool decor! 

I LOVE Fable"
Fable,"So, I saw this place on Yelp and I thought, ""Yes! Fresh, local ingredients!"" I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. Well, the dishes are pricey and it seems the main seasoning they use is sea salt. 

Although they replaced my dish, it was only after much coaxing and a detailed, in-depth explanation that their pumpkin risotto was bland, too creamy, too salty, and what makes you think pesto goes with this? It does not, sir; no sir, it does not. 

The waitresses were genial, which was nice, but overall menu options were limited, overpriced, and cooking was done by amateurs (it looked like they hired the kitchen staff from UBC's Pit Pub or something).

No, probably won't be back."
Fable,"Good. Not great.

The canned tuna was good but not spectacular.

The chickpea fritters were dry but had a delicious sauce and pickled red onions.

Lentil ragout was the worst out of three lentil dishes I've had lately (note that the other two were amazing)

The best part of the meal was the salted almond chocolate bark that came with our dessert."
Fable,"I was here for brunch a year ago and it was good, but didn't blow my mind. I came back for dinner this time around and loved it. My partner has a bunch of food sensitivities and the staff were really awesome about it. We got two starters, the chickpea fritters (sorta falafel, topped with pickled onions, watercress, and curry mayo) and the 'best canned tuna' (albacore poached in olive oil, cherry tomato, potato, lemon rind). They were pretty tasty. We also split the special, which was a Peace River lamb rack and house-made merguez, on a bed of spaetzle mixed in with some finely chopped kale, and drizzled with a rich tasty sauce speckled with mustard seeds. 

They actually served the spaetzle on the side to accommodate my partner's food sensitivities. :) The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare (although could have used a tiny touch more salt), the merguez was tasty, and the spaetzle was like chowing down on a million tiny fluffy pancakes. Delightful! 

Personally, I think this place has Chambar beat. Hands down."
Fable,"On vacation with my family (party of 13, but only 8 went to dinner) from San Diego and found this place on yelp!  We needed a place that would accommodate a large party last minute. From the moment I made the call over the phone to the time we left the service was great and definitely a place I would come back to regularly if we were from here. The food did not disappoint!   I think we ordered more than half the menu and it was ALl great!!!  I would post pictures, but we ate it all before we could even think to take a pic.  . And since they knew we were from out of town they gave us some recommendations for some other great food stops while here.  Hands down best experience overall!!"
Fable,"This place was even better than advertised!  The flavors were well thought out and paired together perfectly with subtle unique twists that really get you thinking about the ingredients.  The well conceived dishes were expertly carried out and the service was amazing.  The entire staff was helpful, intelligent and friendly.  This place is a Vancouver must!"
Fable,"Okay, like everyone else, I've heard all the hype about Fable.  I believe the sister restaurant is Campagnolo, and I like that place.

So, I showed up 6:00 on a Friday night with no reservation.  I didn't expect to get seated that night, but I thought at least there could a slim possibility that my party of two could wait at the bar for a table.  Nothing doing.  The restaurant was full.  The bar was also full.  Okay.  Popular.  Good for them.  Now here's the irritating part:  The ditsy hostess actually suggested with a straight face that we stand at the entrance for the 45 minutes or so that she estimated it would take to get a seat at the bar -- even though the next table wouldn't be available until 8:30.

If there's one thing that irritates me, it's when restaurants get an opinion of themselves that is in the clouds, and they are doing mankind a huge favour by simply being open.  Well, this is Vancouver.  There are hundreds of spectacular places to eat, and Fable will not be one of them, for me.  And that high opinion that they have of themselves now may be on borrowed time, because 99% of restaurants don't sustain that level of success.  I don't hope for their failure, but they're kind of setting themselves up for a hard landing.  I had the same issue with Chambar a few years ago and I haven't been back since.  Chambar is doing fine, I hear, and that's great for them.  But I can't be bothered with these hoity-toity attitudes.  It spoils my appetite.  Hence the 2-star."
Fable,"Having moved to Kitsilano not too long ago, I just say this is a neighbourhood favourite and one I always recommend for out of town visitors! Absolutely delicious upscale comfort food and good vibes all round. Make a reservation or if you get lucky you can walk-in and sit at the bar."
Fable,We are a big group from San Diego and we chose this restaurant based in reviews.  We enjoyed their friendly service and interesting entrees and desserts.  The staff gave us a number of recommendations to help us on our vacation.  The Kiss from a Rose drink was really good!  We ate the slow cooked salmon served with clams and an asparagus and peas soup mixture that was delicious.  I highly recommend this place.
Fable,"Went in for lunch today and the food and service was great. We had the chickpea fritters, the tuna salad and the lunch special which was a breakfast sandwich. Our server was there when we needed her and our waters were always topped up. Will be definitely back to try more dishes!! Love the farm to table concept they have!"
Fable,"I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while! I love the atmosphere and decor. Our server was great and really helpful. We started off with the tomato soup...the little grilled cheese in the middle was incredible! the kitchen was slammed with orders so they brought us a salad on the house which I thought was really nice of them. The sea bass I ordered was great..,the fingerling potatoes that came with it were so amazing! The oops I dropped the dessert dessert was delicious and fun. I really loved the food and could go on describing it but that's a job better left for the taste buds. The care and love shown by the staff was really a cut above and one of the reasons I very strongly recommend this restaurant. We really appreciated the chef making a personal recommendation for the vegetarian dish and coming to our table to express his care and passion for extraordinary food. 

Will definitely be returning :)"
Fable,"This is another 3.5* place. I feel like I'm being hard on Fable, because there was so much that was great. But a place like this should have quality cocktails, or at least decent ones. Based on earlier reviews describing the same problem, Fable just hasn't bothered. It makes me wonder about the quality of their wine list.

*The good and great:
-The special appetizer, the cheese cornbread, was very good. It wasn't super-rich and wasn't dry, the cheese wasn't overwhelming, and the jalapeno whipped butter worked well with it.
-The chickpea fritters are incredible. The combination of fritters with the house-made mayonnaise (!!) and pea shoots (I think?) with pickled onions.. wow.
-The trout was also amazing. I just made an open-faced sandwich with the leftovers, and it is still amazing. Worth the price, except that it may have ruined me for lesser fish dishes.
-My husband enjoyed the lentil ragout a lot, though I thought it was too salty.

The service was consistently very good.

*The bad:
The cocktails were very disappointing. We ordered two off the menu: an Old Fashioned made with Victoria Gin's aged gin, and I forget the name, but the ingredients started with Wiser's Deluxe whiskey and ended with Giffard's pomegranate. We also had a Manhattan. They were all bad, and some of them seemed uninformed.

Old Fashioned drinks are whiskey drinks, so I knew ordering one with an aged gin would be experimental, it might not be my favorite, and that would be okay. It would have been, except that it looked like a take on the Old Fashioned served before people remembered that it's supposed to be a simple drink. It had an orange slice and maraschino cherry and was very sweet.

The Wiser's drink: Wiser's Deluxe is an okay Canadian whiskey. Still, the drink sounded interesting on the menu. It started promisingly, with a grapefruit garnish that was nicely done.. but drinking it was like drinking pomegranate syrup. No balance, barely a sense of the whiskey or other ingredients. And of course it was small.

I don't complain when I dislike something as a matter of personal preference, only on the rare occasions when it's clear that something went drastically wrong (corked wine, it tastes like someone spilled the salt on my dish, etc). But this was so bad that when the waitress asked how the cocktails were, we actually said something. She was great, and offered to take it off the bill and replace it with something else. So my husband asked for a Manhattan, as a generally safe drink he likes.

It was the worst Manhattan either of us has tasted in a long time, and this time I'm including what I got from the open bar at a recent conference reception.

Vancouver has some great bars, and its fine restaurants tend to take their cocktails seriously. Maybe they serve mostly wine and beer and have specialized cocktail offerings, with a small selection of bottles and specific drinks; maybe they find someone who really knows the world of cocktails to run their bar. Either way, they use quality ingredients, know what classic drinks should look and taste like, and work to make sure their house cocktails are good and maybe even interesting. It seems that Fable needs to take advantage of the resources this town has. There are some interesting bottles behind its bar, but I wonder if there's anyone who would know what to do with them. And if there is, why were even basic drinks so darn bad?"
Fable,"Went last night for dinner for the first time. The service was impeccable - they've done a great job hiring staff that clearly like food and are happy to talk about menu items and what's in them. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We were served very quickly, and the food was all delicious. They had a lot of seasonal fresh specials to offer and delicious cocktails. The atmosphere was casual, but the food was excellent and the service some of the best I've experienced in the city. 

Highly recommend, and I will definitely be back. Thanks for a great evening!"
Fable,"Gone are the days of Refuel's Buttermilk Fried Chicken and bone marrow. Before I even went around to write about Refuel, the space has been taken over by Fable for almost a year (since March 2011). I better not procrastinate any longer. Before Chef Trevor Bird from Top Chef Canada goes anywhere. Fable is located on West 4th in Kitsilano. The menu is concise but has a lot of varieties.
  
Not much has changed in terms of the decor, fancy red bricks, wood tables and a fabulous chalkboard wall in the back. The service here is top notch and the food is impeccable with lots of great textures and flavors  I came here many months ago for a girl's night out, while I longed to seat at the bar to soak in all the kitchen action and see secrets maneuvering skills Bird pulls out, we grabbed a table near the front.
 
House Bread: Tarragon and orange butter with rosemary, olive oil and butter focaccia. The bread is salted lightly on top and holds a melt in your mouth yet does not crumple as you spread the butter. The smell is amazging: pigmented with rosemary herbs and a humble citrus flare. But what took this baby home was the butter. If you like garlic butter... it can not compare.  This was a good start.
 
Our waitress was such a dear and explained everything to us, never rushed us, and made sure to give us plenty of great recommendation.
  
Canned Tune ""The Best Canned Tuna"" 12: Albacore Tuna, fingerling potatoes marinated with lemon and sage, served with sea salt on the side and crostinis. The sous-vide fish is tender and moist. The olive oil made it slightly on the oily side, but it is no doubt sinful. Sea salt cuts thru the fattiness nicely while the potatoes packed in  all the flavours in a small mason jar .
 
Chickpea Fritter 9: Pickled red onion, shoots, curry mayo and pea shoots. This battered breading was filled with curry reduction in a light density. I liked how it wasn't overly crunchy and the curry mayo was powerful enough to standout without stealing the show. Tartness of pickled onions was needed to lighten the heaviness of the dish and added great sharp textures.
 
Veal Breast Raviolli (daily special) 23: A bounty of game meat that wasn't gamy. This was no doubt a bold dish with bold flavours. Unfortunately the veal was slightly tough which Bird explained later it was perhaps the cut he chose. Raviolli was beautiful with juices and meat all stuffed inside.
 
Spaghetti and Meat Ball 11: Duck meat ball served over tagliatelle. The flavorful meatball was impressive. Juice and the sauce oozed out as we slit it apart. The tomatoe and duck au jus reduction was perfect for the al dente pasta.
  
To continue our epic meal, we moved onto desserts.
  
Daily Sweet Bites 10: Mini Pavlovas filled with rhubarb and blueberries. What's not to love about this elegant dessert with a fluffy meringue? nothing. It's amazing. The pavlovas were crisp and airy. Blueberry Macarons had a crispy eggshell exterior. I liked the fact it was not tremendously sweet. The love-hate dual Curtis Luk and Trevor Bird nailed it. Sable Cookies were buttery soft but forgettable. 
 
Bread Pudding (daily special): Vanilla cream and rhubarb sorbet.  A simple way to transform stale bread into a timeless classic comfort food. Drizzled with blueberry sauce (as you can tell blueberries and rhubarb was the season's finest!). Slightly toasted golden brown bread adds for an extra special touch while the bottom layer is moist and sweet. The sorbet was refreshing and broke away from traditional flavours!
 
Yay! We were all star stricken! We love you Bird!"
Fable,My favorite restaurant in vancouver. An explosion of taste from beginning to end. And the staff is lovely. Couldn't decide between the desserts so they gave me minis of both. Will come back here again and again!
Fable,"I figured I didn't tip enough so I'm here to make it up with a good review. 
My friends and I went for brunch, we were seated immediately upon arrival. The servers were pleasant, always smiling and attentive to our needs, but towards the end it felt that they were rushing us, 3 minutes within our plates being taken away the bill was on our table (guess I have to add that there were a lot of empty tables around us at that point). 
The food was perfect, my omelette was extremely delicious, they really don't skimp on the ingredients. There was enough food (and protein) to keep me going until dinner time. 
Great place, great decor, highly recommended."
Fable,"Having been to the infamous Boozey Brunch at Fable, I already knew the food was amazing and the service quite friendly. Knowing this, I couldn't wait to bring my out-of-town mother here for my brother's birthday.  On a busy Friday evening, we sat down for some mouthwatering food and a couple of cocktails to celebrate Chris' big day.

After looking over the menu, I had to order the beef tartare special, which came with a side of housemade sour cream and onion chips. The chips were crispy and flavourful, without being overly salty.  The beef itself was tender, but lacked seasoning. That being said, my standards for beef tartare have become quite high after sampling Gordon Ramsay's smoked beef tartare at GR Steak.

As some of you may know, I adore duck.  However, it is one of those meats that can be difficult to execute as it quite rich and can be fatty when not cooked correctly.  Luckily, the duck breast at Fable was done perfectly, with the fat rendered down and a lightly crisp skin.  The slight acidity of the apple purée cut through the richness of the meat and the spatzle was a delicious addition.

My mom ordered the Potato Crusted Chicken and was pleased with the juicy meat layered on ratatouille. The potato layer had a good snap to it and added texture to the dish. My brother and his girlfriend had the Steak Frites and the Tomato Risotto, respectively.  The steak had a nice sear on the outside and was served medium/medium rare, with very tender meat.  The risotto was creamy and packed with lovely heirloom tomatoes.  Everyone at the table was happy with their choices.

Since we were at Fable to celebrate my brother's big 4-0, dessert was certainly in order.  Our waitress brought over a Lemon Meringue Parfait on the house and we also ordered the Blueberry Lavender Tart and the Mascarpone Cheesecake.  The parfait had a nicely torched meringue topping and loads of tart lemon curd. Bits of streusel added crunch and there was a layer of mildly sweet tarragon ice cream.  The blueberry tart had crisp pastry and flavourful, fresh blueberries.  The accompanying buttermilk ice cream was creamy and not overly sweet. However, I wasn't able to taste any lavender, which I was hoping to savour.  My favourite of the three desserts was the Mascarpone Cheesecake with local berries and ripe figs.  The mascarpone gave the cake an extra velvety finish and the berries were bright and tart.  

Once again, we had a lovely meal at Fable. I love the seasonal farm-to-table menu and look forward to trying future menus."
Fable,Food was amazing. Cool atmosphere. Had the sourdough appetizer and Wild bc salmon. It was beautifully presented and had so many flavors going on. Perfection. Five stars !
Fable,"This place is always packed!!  Recently I went there for Sunday brunch with my friend.  Since seating was very limited, we opted to sit at the bar otherwise a very looong wait.  Besides my stomach was growling and I was craving for a mimosa.

I had the scrambled eggs with brioche, spinach, bacon and cheese.  Served rustic style.....in a mini cast iron skillet, so cute!  More importantly it was tasty!  My friend saw me eating the brioche and she totally drooled over that.  So we asked the chef for some, and he was kind enough to bring some brioche our way.  My mimosa was very refreshing.  They used fresh squeeze grapefruit juice.  I get my vitamin C in my favorite drink. :)"
Fable,"Fantastic dinner spot.

Amazing, locally sourced food- fresh and yummy. 

Favourites:
canned tuna
salmon 
steak frites

Make sure you call ahead and book a reso as there is always a line of hungry people waiting to get in!"
Fable,"A wonderful restaurant experience with amazing service and really good local food. We came here on a weekday night and managed to get a table without a reservation. Our server was incredibly helpful and came by our table frequently to check that we were enjoying our night! The duck was SO good and so was the slow-cooked halibut. Portion sizes were good and we were full before dessert. One downside is the place is a bit small, so if you're looking to bring a big group make sure you call beforehand to reserve spots."
Fable,"Been here twice for dinner and twice for brunch.  It is a great room and exactly what Kits needed.  Brunch wasn't very busy at the beginning but I think it is picking up.  And the macaroons are the best I have tried.

The first dinner there we had the canned tuna, chickpea fritters, oysters, and the duck breast.  The standouts were the chickpea fritters and the scallion perogies that went with the duck breast.  Looking at the menu, they don't seem to have them, which would be a shame, as they were amazing.  

Anyway, this place is definitely worth a stop and the prices are reasonable for this level."
Fable,"Been here for brunch and now finally for dinner!  Have to say, Fable does not disappoint.  Excellent service, casual friendly atmosphere and just really good food.  Canned tuna, duck with quinoa base (can't remember what else but the combination was nutty and delicious!) and a shmear of apple sauce made this as standout dish.  Had a piece of my dining companion's medium rare flat iron steak and I could've had another, and I am not a steak-person usually.  Amazing, solid, good food!  Dinner entrees were almost all less than $30 which is great value for the quality!"
Fable,"Came to this place to try something new and fresh in the West 4th area, and was glad to have made a reservation, as it was busy, even on a weeknight.

Fable prides itself with sourcing its products locally, with its tag line, ""From Farm to Table"". So I was hoping to really enjoy a good well-made meal.

We started off with the chickpea fritters and the daily special pesto milk bread. The chickpea fritters were a bit on the dry side but packed quite a bit of flavor. The milk bread was amazing it came on a hot skillet, perfect for keeping it nice and warm, with all that pesto flavors soaking into each bite.

My wife had the duck breast (with preserved berries and mustard spatzle). It was pretty amazing duck! It was cooked perfectly and was tender throughout.

I had the squash gnocchi (squash puree, pea shots, apple gastrique, and sage pesto) and added the pull pork for $4. The goat cheese topping could have been less, as it was quite a dollop right on top. However, the gnocchi was nice and chewy, but they also had slightly pan-fried it, as there were some charred section, which only added to the texture.

Definitely a great place to eat some good, local food. Definitely make a reservation as this place always looks packed!"
Fable,Had their daily breakfast schedule. Wow. Blown away! The chickpea fritters were amazing! And the farmers muffin was something to write home about. Great job Fable!!!
Fable,"The ambiance is cozy and lively and the waitstaff were great, but the food was only okay. I wanted to like it more, but it just fell flat. We had party of 6, tasting each others dishes, but only one dish, the Ling Cod, stood out as  excellent.  Maybe it was just an off night? It's expensive so I am not sure I will be back to give it another go, though."
Fable,"We came here after rejected by farmers apprentice.  On google it said they were open for brunch at 10... nope. Its 11.
We showed up 10mins early and waited in line with a few people in front of us.  Got seated quickly.  Excellent service.  Friendly and warm.  Very attentive for a small yet busy establishment. 
We got the scramble egg and the benedict.  We wanted the flatiron braise but they didnt make them that day.  Scarmble eggs was good a bit too much cheeze.  Love the brioche but nothing new.  The benedict came with egg and tomatoe jam.  Cheeze covered sausage with black pepper jam.  The sausage was the highlight of the meal.  They were so good we ordered a side of sausage.  The pepper jam was a bit too sweet.  Good combo though.  
Both dishes came with scandanavian inspired potatoe cake.  To me it tasted like latka with chive yogurt on top.  Traditional scand. potato cakes are more mashed style with dill, beet, or berry jam.  Yogurt seems to be more jewish or middle eastern.  
Overall i would return to get dinner, but not with a wait time more than 15 minutes.  Not sure if they will reserve seatings for 2."
Fable,"After hearing loads of great reviews about third place, my Fable cherry has been popped. 
This place was chosen for my birthday dinner, just me and my other half. A super rare (like unicorn rare!) Date night away from kids. 
While I don't really fault anyone for this, I feel it's worth mentioning... the yelp attributes for this joint indicated that it is not good for kids. The prices of the menu suggest it's not geared for kids. Our reservation was for 7:30 which is getting late for kids... so imagine my surprise when we were seated next to... a toddler. 
At first I was silently horrified. Oh no... the first night in MONTHS I get a break from kid noise and I actually still am listening to a toddler. At the time the munchkin was being held because she had started to fuss and was banging the table with a spoon. At first I thought ""who brings a small child to a place that doesn't have high chairs?""... but wait... they DO have high chairs,  and a bucket of toys it appears. Fortunately for my exhausted and worn out self,  the family was on their last course and left soon after... but there you go... they ARE kid friendly... which on any other day would make me very happy. Just thought you should know... kids are a possibility here.
Anyway... service, totally amazing. 
For food, we had the halibut steam buns special to start and it BLEW my mind! Pow... blown. I wish this was a regular menu item so I could order it every day.
Our mains were also awesome. I had the duck, which was very good, although not my favorite... my date had the pork special (which I can't remember the actual name of) and it was FABULOUS. All caps worthy type fabulous.
So in conclusion... you NEED to eat here, just go on a night where you're ok with running into children."
Fable,"My husband and I went on a Friday night for dinner and I was immediately impressed by the service. We showed up at 6:55 without a reservation and they offered us a table as long as we thought we could be finished by 8:00 to make room for the next reservation. We jumped at the chance. 

The place was packed and extremely busy. The decor was rustic and farm-like while paintings offered a trendy edge. Wine was displayed in wooden shelves. It appeared as though they were running out of space as there were wine boxes stacked against the wall behind us and it looked like they were storing stuff under the booths near us. 

Our waitress was great but she had trouble, in the chaos of the evening, remembering the details of one of the specials and she skipped it entirely and went to the next special. Otherwise, our service was excellent. 

As an appetizer, I had the chickpea fritters. Amazingly delicious and the presentation was great. The fritters were crisp on the outside while maintaining the integrity of moisture of the inside. The curry mayo offered a great deal of flavor. My husband had the canned tuna and he enjoyed it. It was served with a tiny spoonful of salt (to be stirred into the tuna) as well as tiny slices of bread. I thought the presentation was very creative and it went along with the theme of the restaurant as it was served in a mini ""mason"" jar. 

As an entree, I had the potato crusted chicken. I have to admit that when it was put in front of me, I studied it for awhile to try to figure out how in the world they made it. It was like a ""roll"" of chicken that had been covered by a roll of potatoes. It was nothing like I had imagined it would be, but it was likely much better than what I was imagining. The potatoes had a crisp outer ring while the inside was much like mashed potatoes. The chicken was moist and flavored well. Perhaps my favorite part of the dish was the base layer of flavorful ratatouille on which the chicken-potato roll was sitting. Without the ratatouille, I feel the dish would have been otherwise on the bland side. The ratatouille offered a flavorful punch. My husband ordered the medium rare steak frites and he enjoyed it. I sampled a bite of his steak and it was very good.

I felt the portion sizes needed to be larger for the price. I fully understand that the price represents the execution and attention to complex dishes, but still, there needed to be more on my plate to be considered a entree. When I left, I was still a bit hungry."
Fable,"We made a reservation for 7 pm by mistake at fable at San Fransisco, and although the place was packed and fully booked for the night and the next one, the manager was super nice and moved things around to arrange a table for us. He also got a box of toys for the one year old with us. The atmosphere was really cool and the staff were super nice. 
About the food, let me just say that this is the first time I enjoyed the starters and the main course and the desserts at the same place!
The started us with an amazing in store baked bread and butter with anchovies which was reallllllly nice. 
Then we ordered tthe tomato soup with grilled cheese and the canned tuna (not just canned tuna!) and they were both AMAZINGGG! Then I tried the BC salmon which was superb with potatoes, hummus and kale, my husband tried the grilled steak and he said it was cooked to perfection, our friend tried the smoked duck breast and he absolutely loved it. Then we tried the three items on the dessert which were really good as well. The portions for all the plates were just right. Simply put best restaurant I have been too!
PS: looks like they change the menu frequently."
Fable,"On a visit to Vancouver from Seattle we found Fable completely randomly.  Maybe because it was a Tuesday night we had no trouble getting in instantly-- just had to sit at the bar.  But honestly that was even better.  We got to watch the chefs churn out plate after plate of amazing looking food that made us sad to have just one stomach! 

I had the halibut.  It was moist, flaky, and sitting in the most delicious corn sauce concoction!  My husband had the gnocchi.  It was buttery and the pea pesto with mushrooms was amazing!  I had to steal a few bites of that as well.  

Cocktails were delicious as well.  

We finished off by sharing the mascarpone cheesecake and even though we were completely stuffed we could have eaten two of them!
 Delicious! 
Honestly anyone who doesn't like this restaurant should be given a coupon for McDonalds and be banned from expressing an opinion about food."
Fable,"I came here with with my boyfriend and 4 friends last month for my birthday and i must say, it was one of the best meals i have ever had! 

The place was bumpin when we got there, full to the door on a Sunday evening, which for me is not a bad thing, but an great sign and made my group that much more excited. The staff was great throughout the whole experience. They were very accommodating on the phone when adjusting our reservation and polite during the wait when we arrived. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Knowing it was a bday, she was thoughtful enough to leave the drink menu on the table ;)
she informed us of all the specials (of which there are many given that everything is so fresh!) and our friend chose to start with chicharrons. It arrived promptly at the table, piping hot from the fryer and still crackling with a side of Parmesan foam. The highlight would have to be the cheese foam, because none of my party had tried anything like it and it was very exciting to our taste buds. We were all very happy with our entrees, I had the cod on chorizo lentils, and it blew my mind. Everyone was pleased with the array of flavors. I could go on forever but i want to make sure to mention the drinks! The drink menu had something for everyone. It was unique and some were adventurous! My personal favorite was the Fabletini.

This place was worth every penny with quality and service. I will be back, next time for brunch!"
Fable,I've been here to eat multiple times and it has never disappointed. The atmosphere is great. I really liked the unique light fixture made with pitchforks. And the food is tasty! There were vegetarian options on the menu. I will be returning here again!
Fable,Used to like this place when It first opened and been quite a few times. The food was very good.  Now it is too busy and the lady working there was  a bit annoying. This place needs improvements. Can't really recommend this place anymore.
Fable,"I like Falble a lot. Yes, it can be a wait to get in (uh, cause its good maybe?) and I wish the tables we not so close together, but it doesn't deter me from returning. The staff seem to really care about, and be knowledgeable on the food they serve. AEverything is Always super fresh. 
Last time I went for girls night out, and we did not like the tuna appetizer. I wasn't complaining, I just said it was ""ok"" when asked by the waitress, and she insisted they replace it with something I would love. We were later approached by the manager who explained they looked into it, and realized one of the key ingredients was omitted in error. Excellent Service. I really appreciated the extra care, and I'm more then happy to recommend you try this place if you have not."
Fable,"As with many new American/Canadian places I've tried, feels like the appetizers outshine the main courses. 

Corn bread (seasonal special) - 4 best I've ever had
Chickpea Fritters - 3.5
""Canned Tuna"" - 3.5 interesting preparation, worth a try

Smoked Duck Breast - 3.5
Butcher's Cut (Chuck) - 2.5, was drier than I had expected for a sous vide dish
Pork Loin - 3

There was another appetizer, another main, and two desserts, but I don't remember what they were, and they didn't stand out."
Fable,"I was enamored with the level of customer service the staff at ""Fable"" provided. We were well taken care of by all three ladies working the floor. They checked in on us and saw to it that we enjoyed every part of our meal. The parts where we didn't, we were offered solutions to rectify the situation. This was done without us having to press for it or suggest it. How refreshing to be put first. Each waitress possessed great energy and was happy to go into detail over the food. I asked for suggestions and explanations over menu items. Not only did they added clarity but sold me on them as well. And for those reasons alone I will be coming back. Not even mentioning how delicious the food was. I enjoyed every creamy bite knowing it was made with the best ingredients and I was putting good healthy foods into my belly. 

Would I recommend it? - Absolutely. I was awestruck over the decor, swept off my feet by the staff, and given an experience close to angelic with the food. There was nothing I did not enjoy about tonight. And if the line ups were any indication, most of Vancouver felt the same way. Don't deny your cravings to sample what the best of the farms have to offer."
Fable,"Make a reservation this place is bumping!

The food here is well seasoned, beautifully prepared and the service is top drawer without being stuffy.  The fritters were amazing, the cornbread was awesome, my GF's beef cheeks were perfect melt in your mouth delicious. ;0  I had the trout on a mountain of kale.  I love kale and it was a bit too much kale :)  I am please with the attention to detail by the service staff.  I was offered more wine, my cutlery was replaced between courses. The Parfait was exactly that parfait :)  The price is spot on when you consider the quality of the food and service. 
 It is really nice to see the restaurant not getting lost in its concept as is common for restaurants of this style. At the end of the day no matter how great your concept is you still have to serve good food and have great service. Fable nailed the food and the service. Highly recommend.

YPJ"
Fable,"Fable is hands down my favourite restaurant in Vancouver. I have been there on several occasions, including a celebratory dinner last night. I have never been disappointed.  Last night we were the first patrons to order the trout pancake - so unique and delicious. (The canned tuna is another solid appy.) That is why I love this place - the food is unique and the menu is always changing!
For such high quality and delicious food, I always feel like the bill is far too small. Service is always a cut above."
Fable,"So many attempts at fancy brunch in Vancouver, and so many of them drain my wallet and make me wish I cooked up greasy bacon and eggs at home. Show me something special!

Fable is something special. Steak and Eggs. Black coffee. Try it.

#30DaysOfYelp (10/30)"
Fable,"What a great name for a restaurant because every time I tell someone about it I can say ""Fable, you know like farm to table."" I don't know why, but I love saying that, it makes me feel witty.

We went to Fable on a double date. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I don't think there was one bit of food left on our plates. We were delighted with the fresh ingredients and good flavors. There were lots of interesting new things I never heard of but really liked, such as chorizo crusted halibut and duck meat balls. 

For dessert, I had the lemon pot de creme and seriously, this dessert was amazing. To me lemon desserts can be on the tart side and I never really order them. But it was a special night and had already made up my mind that I would have dessert. The dessert had gin foam, ice lemonade shavings, creamy lemon custard, and wonderful vanilla seeds sprinkled on the bottom. It was yum.

My only complaint was that the restaurant space is small with lots of tables. Since Fable is so popular, every table was filled which meant it got really noisy in there. But whatever, with food this good, I don't need to have a conversation, I'll just sit back and enjoy my meal."
Fable,"The food was VERY good.  Not amazing.  I can't believe I'm saying this- but I just expected so much more especially in Vancouver.  I think this is good food with a higher price point than I'd like to pay.

Funny thing is if I were in Toronto this would be a solid 4 star establishment.  But because I'm so used to really good, high quality and low-priced good food in Vancouver...well..it gets one star off.

At the table we had:
The feature appetizer- almost like an arancini- but meatier... gotta say- it was like a meaty-glorified falafel (3/5)
Eggplant main- breaded eggplant, really flavourful (3.5/5)
Chicken main- nice tender chicken , ratatoullie- again, very flavourful (3.5/5)
Salmon main- good salmon, not overdone at all but I like my salmon a little underdone- this would be the equivalent to ""medium"" for a steak.  came with gnocchi- was really good. (4/5)
two glasses of wine- standard selections- only a few by the glass but many by the bottle.

97$ excluding tip

The food was modest but good portion- definitely not over-thetop- you will likely be finishing your main plate and you will want an appetizer OR a dessert to pair- if you took three courses that would be too much food.

The dessert menu looked uninpired so we did not partake

Our server and the host were both Aussies.  Nice folks, very polite servers and staff.

It was just a really good experience but I won't be rushing to come back.
Good food.  Fine value, given that it is an oceanwise menu.
But when I go out to eat I want GOOD to very good food with good value.  This does not fit that description.
Nothing was so exciting or rare that, with a little ingredient sourcing from the market and a good pan, I couldn't do myself."
Fable,"I have long believed that there is no dish that can't be improved by the addition of chocolate, bacon and/or applewood smoked cheddar. To this list I will now add a fourth, miraculous ingredient: the black pepper jam at Fable.

The jam was the condiment on my husband's perfectly cooked, beautifully rare steak -- a steak that on its own would be noteworthy. But the addition of the smokey sweet peppery jam turned it into what may be the most delicious meat dish I have ever eaten. Really. Happily, Fable sells its miracle jam by the jar, so it will now be a staple in our own cupboard.

The rest of our meal would be judged well, even if nothing quite lived up to the spectacular heights of the Jam From Heaven. My slow-cooked salmon was a tender, tasty creature, and a departure from the usual salmon dish. The ""canned tuna"" starter was a lemony yummy treat, and while the heirloom tomato salad was quite simply -- just tomatoes, ricotta and chèvre -- the tomatoes were perfect and needed nothing more. And the cornbread we were encouraged to munch on while reviewing the menu was way beyond the usual....it was basically cake! 

Our service was excellent: helpful and friendly without being either obsequiously formal or intrusively chummy. The server recommended a wine that we loved, and the service was prompt without feeling rushed. The room itself is extremely pleasant, though I wouldn't want to sit at the kitchen side bar during this heatwave! 

The menu is very appealing -- I was in the rare position of being tempted by virtually every item on the menu -- so it's the kind of place I'd love to treat as a neighbourhood standby. And on paper, that makes sense: it's a casual enough vibe for every day,  nice enough to feel special for a date, with a delicious but unpretentious menu. It's a little pricey to turn into a regular hangout, however: dinner for two, with wine but without dessert, came to $175 with tip. Not unreasonable for the meal, but not a weekly event either!

Fable is a great addition to the Kits repertoire. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"
Fable,"I've only dined here once, for brunch, but I'm a fan.  I ordered the fable eggs, not realizing the potatoes, greens, etc were served rather like a stew under the egg.  Initially that worried me, but it turned out to taste fabulous.   Also, I've never had tomato jam before, and now I'm talking about growing my own tomatoes to put up cans of jam. Thanks, Fable.  :/   Everything was delicious, service was solid, and the bathroom had some really surprising music (I'm trying to recall -- it was like Bobby Brown or something, and it was the best surprise I've ever gotten in a bathroom).   Fable is A+ in my book.  Can't wait to plan another trip around brunch options..."
Fable,Mushroom oatmeal risotto was superb.  The blend of textures was definitely the most intriguing aspect of my dining experience here.
Fable,Great place for brunch!  Theres also ice cream next door if you're feening for something else sweet.
Fable,"We went to Fable for brunch and instantly added this to our favorite breakfast places.  The service was excellent and very friendly, prompt with coffee which is important on a Saturday morning!

We had the scrambled eggs and the ling cod benny and both were great.  I also tried their bacon and was impressed.  The bread that came with the scrambled eggs was delicious as was the jams.  

Very happy with this find and looking forward to returning!"
Fable,"The good reviews have drawn me towards visiting Fable the other day for a nice light lunch. My seared tuna squash salad was quite delicious and embodied with rich flavors from a good variety of fresh ingredients. My date had the daily special: Open breakfast sandwich with bacon eggs and black pepper jam on a thick toast with salad. We shared a Lemon meringue parfait in the end, I really liked it because of its nice floaty presentation and the bread/pie crumbs had just the perfect crunch texture and buttery taste. Tho my date thought it was a bit too much on the sour lemon side, and the ice cream the put in the centre had a peculiar licorice taste. I would definitely come back here to try more items on their dinner menu! Ps. The place doesn't seem to be big enough for its popularity so do make reservations or avoid the meal rush hour. Pps. Fable apparently stands for ""from farm to table"" =P brilliant!"
Fable,Had the duck and pork and was absolutely delighted with the food and the service was awesome!
Fable,"Great host/hostess. If the are quite booked, they suggest to seat at the bar, and if a table is available, they will try to put you in. Friendly servers too. They come and check on you, so you don't feel like you always need to get their attention like some other places. But most important, the food is awesome. Great portions, not too small, and not too big, enough for you to feel satisfied. They source locally, so everything is fresh. We tried the duck, halibut, gnocci and for appies, the ""canned tuna"", soup and chickpeas. They were all great. We will definitely come back. Oh... we also tried their sister restaurant- Fable Diner --not your fine dining type since it is a diner, but we liked it too, and prices were great for what you get."
Fable,"Amazing, amazing food! I've pretty much been raving about this place to everyone ever since I came here for the first time a couple weeks ago. I like the casual, rustic atmosphere. It's all about the food. I had a scallop appetizer (one of the specials), duck breast, and opera torte.  The duck breast was juicy, and the duck confit croquette underneath was so tasty. The opera torte was perfect, rich, but not overly sweet. I feel like it's not often that I've had such a memorable dessert.

You have to try one of their desserts. Or two. Or three."
Fable,"Went with 3 girlfriends on a Thursday night for dinner. Had to make a reservation one week in advance this place is so hot right now. Totally worth the planning, this meal was one of the best I've had thus far in Vancouver and the service was excellent. 

Appetizer: 
Tuna in a can - interesting concept. I like that it was served warm but I would have liked it more had the potato been whipped. 

Chickpea fritters - great presentation and flavours. They do need a little more binder to hold them together better. 

Main:
Steak frites - delicious. Perfectly executed. It will be hard to go back and not have that dish again. Medium rare.

Dessert:
Lemon tart - this dessert was flawless. Beautifully presented, not too sweet, the ice cream accompanying it was the perfect pairing. I just wish I had ordered a glass of champagne to go with it!

Well done, I will certainly be back soon. Good value for the money."
Fable,"Fable nailed it again! Had the duck the first time and the halibut this time and my wife enjoyed the flank steak both times... Amazing flavor in all their foods and the service is second to none! On top of it all, we celebrated our 5th anniversary with them in which they made a special cheesecake that was by far some of the best cheesecake we have ever had! Would highly recommend everyone to try this amazing restaurant!"
Fable,"Favourite restaurant in Vancouver, hands down. Pricey, but worth it. Great place for special occasions (at least for my broke ass), like anniversary or significant other's bday. Amazing food, you can taste the freshness. Amazing staff and vibe."
Fable,"We loved the food, it was a great experience!  It's best you book in advance to avoid a line up and stress..."
Fable,The server is very professional and nice. The food is made in front of you fresh from scratch. Delicious and creative appetizers and local ingredients. Their dessert was awesome too. I'd definitely go back.
Fable,This place is a must go! Everything we ordered looked and tasted amazing! The pork belly and scallops dish was absolutely divine  and the service was excellent. Big thumbs up!
Fable,"Everything was tasty. We went with server's suggestions. Packed popular, hipster  restaurant. Don't arrive late for your reservation."
Fable,"Was looking forward to hype but a bit of a let down.

Wine menu was good.   We ordered the Painted Rock Icon Red.  Very nice.

Appetizer was decent.  Corn bread was good (4/5).  Pork croquette was so so (3/5).

I had the potato crusted chicken.  What a let down.  Instead of a piece of breast or thigh it was a shredded piece of chicken rolled in potato crust.  If I wanted a chicken burrito I would have gone to Chronic Tacos (no digs, Chronic Taco rocks). So definitely poor rating for main (1-2/5).

Desserts mixed plate was good (4/5).
Service was overally slightly above average (3/5)
Overall not impressed."
Fable,"What is Fable? More than a short story, that's for sure!

During its first week of operation, we arrived at Trevor Bird's kitchen with some friends in hopes to catch a late dinner. Even with a single-sheeted menu, it was difficult to commit to one dish because we couldn't decide what to order. For a small menu, they seem to cover their bases pretty well, and with reasonable prices.

While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we ordered a few appetizers. We began with an order of spaghetti and duck meat ball ($11), canned tuna ($12), and the ubiquitous spot prawn ($12).They advised us that their menu may change slightly, so when our server informed us there is a 5 course tasting menu option ($45), we jumped at the opportunity to sample their creations. It was the best decision ever that Thursday night, aside from choosing to go to the place itself.

I don't think I've had a duck meat ball before, and my first time was amazing! It was served on a bed of tagliatelle, topped off with Parmesan foam. Yes, foamy cheese - picture whipped cream coming out of a can, and that's exactly what we got. Except it was cheese, and we were impressed! But if that wasn't enough to blow your socks off, then the canned tuna will do the job. This creative dish was served in a short canning jar, where the bottom layer of softly cooked potatoes and traces of tomatoes hold the flaky tuna. Before serving, they give you a mini spoon with sea salt, and you'd mix everything up so you can slather it the toasted bread it came with. Best canned tuna ever! With spot prawn season in full swing, you can bet that every chef in town is whipping up their recipe for serving these yummy creatures. The raw and crispy spot prawns were sweet, yet the tanginess of the pickled fennel made it more refreshing.

I would highly recommend the five course tasting menu if you want to sample a little of everything. We got different appies from what we already ordered, so we got the sample sawmill bay oyster, and chickpea fritters. These were amazing as they were perfectly cooked, and the hint of curry added a little kick in that mouthful. The first entree we received was the ling cod and chorizo. It replaced halibut that night, but I didn't mind as cod is a favorite of mine. This was a nice dish, but the best dish of the night was coming next. There in front of us was duck breast, sharing the plate with a nice big scallion perogy and fiddleheads. The meat was super tender, and the duck skin was cooked to crunchy perfection. It tasted sweet, so I think they must have brushed it with a thin layer of honey or some kind of syrup. Dessert was lemon pot de crème, and that was good palate cleanser.

The service was good considering they had just been open for a week. I really hope this place does well. They just got their gift certificates, so it would be a great gift for your foodie friends, or anyone looking for good food."
Fable,"Brunch review only:

Delicious food but not NEARLY enough of it!

Stopped in for brunch here after a recently planned beach day with Jessica ""Violet Dear"" O. was rained out.  We were cruising up W. 4th when we spotted Fable and both realized we really wanted to try it out.  Decision made!

We arrived shortly after the restaurant opened for the day and were promptly seated after passing their open kitchen where Trevor Bird & his crew were hard at work.  Normally a bunch of foodies such as us would have jumped at the chance to sit at the bar and watch them work, but we were looking forward to a good gossip sesh and decided to take a table instead.

We ordered a round of drinks and were very pleased with the Big Best Brunch Caesar (with Gin - who knew?).  The coffee was also quite nice.  After perusing the menu we all settled on the dishes that grabbed our attention and were happily provided with our plates in short order.  I had the Scrambled Eggs - so delish - and came in a cute little mason jar with the creamed spinach & bacon mixture underneath the egg.  I proceeded to scoop out every last bite and chased each with a bite of my toast soldiers.  I will say that while totally delightful, it was just too small.  My dining companions felt similarly about their Benny & Fable Egg.

On the whole the food was excellent and I would certainly return to try their evening offerings (which look amazing), but I wouldn't recommend brunch unless they step up their portions.  Brunch is a meal that should tide you over from morning until supper and this was just not sufficient."
Fable,"I went to this restaurant having watched Top Chef Canada in its entirety, and received what I believe to be Top Chef Canada's best.  It honestly exceeded my expectations.

For appetizers we had the Sawmill Bay oysters with vodka & citrus, canned tuna with crostini, and duck meatball with tagliatelle.

Oysters perfectly accented with what tasted like Grey Goose Vodka and a touch of grapefruit and black pepper. A perfect balance while still tasting the seawater.  Next was the play on ""canned tuna"", which was freshly canned raw Albacore Tuna, lemon confit, potato confit with olive oil poached in a small mason jar, served with grey salt & crostini. Another perfectly balanced dish, the lemon was like candy, and potato and albacore welcomed the grey salt, harmonious....   The duck meatball was crispy outside, medium rare inside stuffed with sauce & served on tagliatelle with parmesan foam.  Big flavors from spices on the meatball, allspice and fennel seed I believe.  I'm not big on foam, but it had great mouthfeel and really tasted like parmigiano reggiano, awesome.

My main was the potato crusted chicken with ratatouille.  I kind of dislike chicken as its usually bland and easily dry.  Trevor Bird's version however, tasted like it was soaked in milk, crusted in potatos and fried to excellence.  The ratatouille was amazing, freshly tasting of basil, and acidic enough to counter the richness of potato & chicken.

Dessert was Curtis Luk's macaroon, cookie and pavlova. Absolute master work! Especially the pavlova. The meringue melted in your mouth. Paired with blueberries I cannot even imagine anything better.

When you combine this food with personable, fast, efficient service & reasonable prices, the only outcome is me and my friends becoming regulars, and we don't even live near this neighborhood!!  Feeling pretty happy about having such talent in our city!  Great work and keep it up"
Fable,Had surprisingly delightful lunch. Hostess at lunch was professional and friendly. Menu choices were interesting. Very fresh. Had mushroom polenta- A little lean on mushrooms but was very unique and delicious.
Fable,"One of the best meals I've ever had! You can tell the chef is excited and takes pride in the food served. It's interesting and thought out, its fun... We shared our courses so that we could try more. Our server was very accommodating and even split the for us, which was pretty cool. We started with the Tomato soup and grilled cheese w/ onion jam. Holy shit it was delicious! We also had the Duck Meat ball cause it seemed to be a favorite... indeed, it was our favorite!  its flawless, DO IT.  For our Main course we had the Fennel, sausage cavatelli, again, it was just perfect the flavors and textures all complement each other. Restaurants like this give me life! Believe the hype, this place is a winner. Plan a head, it gets packed"
Fable,"I've been wanting to go to Fable because of the great food and service.  I was a little disappointed.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I took my sister and brother in law for lunch on Tuesday.

We ordered the best canned tuna (it is the best tuna} and I would come back again just to order it.  We were lucky because it was the last jar they had that day.

For my lunch, I wanted the slow cooked salmon only to find that it was sold out.  So opted for the ling cod.  I have dietary restrictions of no salt, no dairy, and no egg.  The ling cod was perfect however it came with hollaindaise so I asked for a mustard vinaigrette that went with the salmon.


My brother-in-law ordered a steak sandwich and a lemonade.  My sister ordered the pasta of the day with pea pesto, chorizo, parm, tomatoes.

The service that day needed improvement.  When trying to flag a server they were all up front talking to each other, they did not notice us waving our hands.  Our server forgot to get my brother his lemonade, until halfway through when we reminded him.  He apologized and gave him a complimentary lemonade.   With my meal I received hollandaise sauce, which I thought was clear to my server I could not consume.  He apparently didn't tell the person serving my dish that I couldn't eat it.  Poor 
communication between the staff.  They also did not suggest or offer a lemon to put on my fish for lack of any sauce .  As the crowd was thinning, it was clear we had finished and  had empty plates.  I even put them way off to one side, plain as day.  No one was picking them up from us.  There was even a server/hostess cleaning tables next to us and she didn't pick it up.  We felt that there was a lack of attention of serving staff,  They need to circulate more and be aware of their customers, instead of conversing up front.  

Our lunch came to $68.00.  We all thought our meals were good, not great {except for the canned tuna}.  Service was disappointing."
Fable,"Yum. Yum yum yum. We had a really awesome meal here last night - the service and food was all amazing. 

First - a quick note about the service. It was fantastic. Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing. She checked in on us, and because she knew we had to be out by a certain time (had a show to get to) she made sure we could order in time and got our food in time to have a full three courses without feeling rushed. She also suggested a wine that we all ended up loving. She was great.

The food was really tasty. We had the canned tuna. Man, I wish I could buy that stuff in the store instead of the gross little tins of tuna to spread on crackers. So delicious. We also had the chickpea fritters which were really tasty. Two at our table had the steak and loved the black pepper jelly, and I had the gnocci. The other had the pumpkin risotto with fresh crab. His only ""complaint"" was that he expected more pumpkin. But it was still delicious. 

I noticed someone else commented that the gnocchi is hard to recommend as stand alone - sure it didn't have any protein with it, but I have to say it was a big dish and very filling. I thought it was tasty and fine as stand alone.

Anyway - dessert. We ended up with the lemon tart on the table, and the chocolate beet fondant. I didn't try the chocolate beet fondant but apparently it was delish. I thought my lemon tart was to die for. 

I had a really, really good experience and will definitely back. I also was down at L'abbatoir this same week and thought Fable was better - I liked the menu, flavours and service better. Well done."
Fable,"AMAZING! Must go!
My hubby and I went there last night, and boy did this place exceed our wildest expectations.
We knew it was a farm to table place, knew the guy who owns it was runner up Master Chef Canada, but that was about it.

I had the the smoked duck with brussel sprouts, and it was to DIE for. 
It comes out on a fun skillet brought to us by the chef.  I could eat this everyday. The brown butter sauce was amazing.  My hubby had the duck special, all I remember was how amazing the bed of lentils under it were.

We had the fried duck giblets for an entree with the waldorf salad and it soo good!

For a nicer meal, it was worth the value... we paid just under 100 bucks for:
2 mains, 2 entrees, bread, a beer and large bottle of San palegrino. 

MAKE a reservation. We went on a monday, and it was busy.
This owner has class, there was a baby at the next table and he brought the baby out carrot puree... 

Go and support this guy.
Cheers. 

christina"
Fable,"Excellent service, great food.  
I had the Arctic Char and shared the Chickpea Fritters & ""Canned Tuna"", all exceeded my expectations... great flavour.  
Only odd thing was the Arctic Char was served on a huge plate and was placed on the side... leaving a lot of blank white space. It tasted amazing, so no points deducted
Will definitely be back!"
Fable,"Had an unplanned dinner there with the hubby the other night.  I enjoyed every course - I had the canned tuna, hubby had the chickpea fritters and then we moved on to the Steak Frites (me) and the pork with corn on the cob dinner special (hubby).  His dinner was summer on a plate and the steak frites was perfect - a lean and flavorful cut of steak with pepper jelly, tender crisp veggies and the frites were fantastic - triple cooked so that they were crispy on the outside and mealy on the inside, just how I like them, without a bad one in the pile.

The service was great, friendly and attentive, but not intrusive.  

My only regret was that we didn't have room for dessert, so we'll need to come back."
Fable,"Food prepared with love. Knowledgable, friendly staff who deliver excellent service. I had a lettuce wraps appetizer (offered as a special), which came with salmon, pickled fennel, cilantro, and pickled onions. The pickled fennel was especially good and added a unique flavor. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
Fable,"Fable is a must visit! 

Cozy decore and food that was incredibly good (Try the ""Canned Tuna"" and the chef's tasting menu) and friendly and attentive service.   Also if you get the chance sit at the Chef's bar as it is a great way to chat about the food and see how everything is made.

It was an amazing date night and I am sure we will be back soon. 

- Chris"
Fable,"I had heard about Fable through our CSA program, as Fable buys produce through local farms.  We went for my dad's birthday, and the food was excellent!  

I had the milk poached chicken which was super juicy and delicious.  Our table also tried the squash gnocci (so good!!), beef stiletto (they were out of frites), cheesecake, and sweet bites.  The portions were generous, and we ended up with leftovers for lunch the next day!

Our only complaint was the fact we had reserved a table in advance (and they asked if it was a special occasion which it was), but we were seated at the first table which has heavy traffic from the kitchen and front door.  I regretted having the hostess hang up my jacket as every time someone opened the front door a draft blew over our table.  I would have enjoyed our experience much better had we been seated further inside the restaurant and will keep that in mind in the future as we will be back!"
Fable,"With Top Chef Canada's Trevor Bird and Curtis Luk in the kitchen on a regular basis...of course the ""Farm to Table"" concept is going to be amazing!

The menu changes with the season...and on my first trip to Fable ...we had Brunch...with a capital ""B"" because it was that good!

We got there just as the doors opened on a Sunday morning...a small crowd waiting outside for the warmth and comfort of amazing food!  We were seated right away...and although I had made up my mind ahead of time from reading the menu online...I threw caution to the wind and changed up what I was going to get at the last second...it all sounded so good...how could I possibly only choose one dish???

Easy...make sure your friend gets something different from you! LOL  My friend ""D"" got the Salmon Benny...and I pretty much got straight up Eggs and Hash.  We also ordered sides of their House Bacon with Apple Jam and the House Sausage with Black Pepper jam!  All of the food was amazing...however there was one component of the meal that was outstanding.  My meal came with Tomato Jam...now most Foodies...myself included...would probably think that it was just fancy house made ketchup...which is exactly what I was expecting....Wow was I wrong...it was actually Tomato Jam...it was chunks of tomato that were sweet like jam...I can't even put into words how mind blowing it was...I saved a good teaspoon of it on a piece of toast for my last bite! (always have to save the best for last!)

I left with a happy tummy...warm and comforted by food made by people I used to watch on TV!  I couldn't be happier....or maybe I could be...maybe...just maybe...I'll have to stop in for dinner sometime to see what other savory goodies they have concocted!"
Fable,"Just went here for dinner last night with my wife.  We had a great meal.  We started with the chickpea fritter (they were great - maybe a tad dry but great) and then she had the Halibut and I had the Steak Frites.

Everything is fresh and the drinks are amazing.  Would recommend visiting, but make sure you have reservations!"
Fable,"Delicious! I went a few weeks ago while in Vancouver for work and I'm still thinking about the B.C. oysters. These were my colleague's first oysters and he loved them!

To start, we shared the chickpea fritters - I loved the combination of curry mayo and pickled onions with the fritters. For my main, I had the steak frites and wasn't disappointed one bit. But the highlight was the dessert - we shared the gorgonzola cheesecake. You can definitely taste the blue-cheese in it, but it's not overpowering at all. The cheesecake itself is very creamy, and the pears cut through to give it just the right amount of sweetness. A must try!"
Fable,"I've been here three times -- once for dinner, and twice for brunch! You can't go wrong with anything, and their caesers are just ridiculous good. For dinner, both the halibut and gnocchi were great, and the cornbread special starter was perfect! Portion sizes are good for the high quality of food you're getting, and the service really impressed us. We sat at the bar with a great view of the kitchen (our favourite spot), and the chefs are always working away in a totally calm and precise manner. You gotta buy the kitchen a growler for $10-- it's an option on the menu and our experience was definitely great enough to warrant it! Our server was funny and friendly and it was a really lovely and relaxed place to have a great meal. It's completely unpretentious -- just fantastic food, without the snobbery that can sometimes accompany it. Good wine list too! Will go again."
Fable,"I found this place in an odd fashion. My wife and I had one day to spend in Vancouver so we looked online and found someone's review of a perfect day in Vancouver. This included a day trip to Kits and eating at Fable. He said it was a special place and my wife and I are very happy we took a shot in the dark and did this. What an awesome restaurant. We got there just in time for brunch...actually we were late, but the wait staff seated us anyway...we had just finished walking the better part of 6 miles and I can't tell you how much we appreciated this. I can't remember what the name of the dish was I ordered but it was an omlette of some sort...and was delicious. They have this tomato jam that was so good we bought some to take home. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Kits...

Unfortunately the TSA took the jam we bought from us on our return to the US.   :(...I wonder if I can order some more?"
Fable,"I really thought this restaurant was over-rated.  Perhaps its as an off night for the chef or we ordered the wrong dishes.  Just felt like we overpaid for the meal.  The decor, staff, ambiance was however excellent.  Because of all the good reviews I do feel obligated to give this place another try and give it another review.  I feel like this is one of those places where the appetizers are better than the main course."
Fable,"Great idea, left me wanting a bit more.  I love Local Farm to Table restaurants and this concept works well here as well.  I think what set me off from the start was being seated closest to the washrooms when I had booked at least a month in advance.  Bad on me not having stated in the reservation my aversion, but aversion it is.  I don't like to make a fuss, so went with it this evening but the tone was set.
I had a cocktail that was very recommended, something with cider that looked just like a shirley temple when it arrived and it was good, but not great and tart or sweet, one or the other, still not sure.  The canned tuna appetizer came highly recommended and the idea is super, but the taste left me wanting something more.  The brininess was less than pleasing and to be honest, not sure what the potatoes were doing there. Something a little spicier would have been nice.  Son #1 had a very respectable flank steak with an almost mole sauce that I would not have enjoyed but he loved it.  Too dark for me but the beef was seared beautifully.  Exactly how meat should be cooked.
Son #2 had the Tuna Nicoise, (he wasn't that hungry!) and it was a perfect salad but the tuna again didn't have that spark of deliciousness that I know it can have.  The best I have saved for last though and that is the Gnocchi.  I had the Squash Gnocchi sans pork (blech and I love pork but what a combo), and it was divine.  I love making Gnocchi and it's so hard to get large Gnocchi to taste that perfect and not be overcooked.  I liked the light searing in butter/oil as well.  They were perfect, seriously.  Could have done without the Sweet Yam saucy gravy swiped on the plate, too sweet, but if they would have served that up with some spring onion, pine nuts and a bucket of olive oil, I might never have left. 

Might be back again, just for that Gnocchi.  Best ever.
Upping to 4 stars simply for the personal touch and the staff.  How wonderful to be remembered and yes, I will mention my preferences up front the next time."
Fable,"My first five-star rating goes to Fable! Went there last night and had a great night. The service, ambience, and food were all fantastic. We were warmly greeted upon arrival, and staff made us feel really welcome and at home. I don't usually get that feeling in a restaurant! The six of us ordered so much food - appys included the canned tuna, cornbread, mushroom flatbread (my least favourite), and chickpea fritters (my favourite); mains included steak (delicious), scallops and pork belly (mmmmm so good), duck (probably the best I've ever had, as another reviewer has said), gnocchi (good but more would have been nice), eggplant parmesan (delicious - loved the way they kept the eggplant whole, covered in cheese and fried it to crunchy perfection), and halibut (so delicious).

Haven't even described the cocktails or dessert...all pretty satisfying.

Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful without being overbearing. We had two different red wines going and she did a good job remembering who was drinking what. Really impressed with Fable and hope to go back...tomorrow for breakfast maybe?"
Fable,"a warm little restaurant. love the atmosphere.

i came here with a friend for brunch and tried their benedicts with olive oil hollandaise and ham. it melted in my mouth. amazing bits of comfort food. love their hash as well - crispy and well seasoned. 

we had to wait 45 min before getting seated but there are small shops around the area and we easily passed the time browsing (and spending more on brunch with an unexpected purchase of a new wallet - oops!)

i would definitely come back to try their dinner some time!"
Fable,"Our family was on vacation from Los Angeles and I happened to find Fable as one of the top rated ""Canadian"" restaurants in Vancouver. We decided to go there and was I glad that we did.. 

I ordered the Rossdown Farms Chicken ,my brother ordered the duck breast, and my mother ordered the Zucchini ""Tagliatelle.""

We were all very pleased with the meal. It went beyond my expectations. 

I was especially concerned for my mother who doesn't like cheese nor cream. However, she was very pleased with the zucchini tagliatelle(without cheese). She mentioned how delicious the sauce was. 

Thank you Fable for a very memorable dinner experience!

Love, 

A fan from LA"
Fable,"So delicious! I had the zucchini stuffed blossom appetizer followed by the whole sea bass caught in Ontario. The presentation was beautiful and the blend of favors and texture was well thought out, kudos to chef. Dessert was a strawberry shortcake parfait that was so creative and delicious. Don't miss this gem of a place."
Fable,"My go-to for celebratory dinners. Nice vibe and amazing food. Basically I order the gnocchi with pulled pork every time, so can't comment much on the rest of the menu. Definitely worth the price. I'd suggest reservations as the restaurant isn't huge and fills up pretty quick."
Fable,"Probably the best restaurant in Vancouver today...unbelievable service, second to none..the chickpea fritters are outsstanding..steak frites to die for...my only complaint they ran out of the red racer IPA AND the Rhubarb desert. TSK"
Fable,the service was excellent and the pork belly special with house made cavaletti was rich and absolutely deeeeeeeelish. would definitely go again!
Fable,"Fable's Boozey Brunch (the last Sunday of each month) is definitely something to check out!  Offering orange or grapefruit mimosas and ceasar's for $4 . . . how can you go wrong?  I will admit that the caesars taste a bit ketchup-y, but for $4 on a rough Sunday, I can't complain.

The restaurant was completely packed and there was a great buzz about the place.  I ordered the Fable Eggs and my boyfriend ordered the Farmer's Muffin.  We also ordered a side of their homemade bacon . . . yup, I said it, HOMEMADE! (yum, yum, yum).  Despite it being so busy, our meal arrived within a reasonable time frame.  

My Fable Eggs came with sunnyside eggs, lardons, mushrooms, potatoes, kale, rustic bread and tomato jam.  The dish was nice, but certainly not the best brunch dish I've ever eaten.  The bottom of the plate was filled with a liquidy substance - I'm guessing it was from the mushrooms, but I'm not entirely sure.  It was just a bit strange and not something I would have expected to see in my dish.  A friend at the table had ordered the same thing and also had a plate full of ""mushroom juice"" as well, so it seemed that this was part of the dish on not a mistake.  Surprisingly, my favourite part of the dish was the tomato jam!  It added just the right amount of sweetness to my savoury dish and helped wrap it all together quite nicely.

My boyfriend's Farmer's Muffin included sausage, scrambled eggs, cheddar, tomato jam, salad and a potato rosti.  It looked like a deconstructed muffin sandwich on the plate.  The sausage was very tasty, as was the hit of the day - the tomato jam!  Everything on this plate went very well together.  No complaints in the flavour and taste department.

We will absolutely be back to Fable very soon!  We love the boozey brunch idea and thought that the prices for the brunch menu were extremely reasonable.  The portions could be slightly bigger, but overall great value for the quality of food.  Although the Fable Eggs on the whole weren't my favourite, there are other items on the menu that I'm excited to try!

Cheers!"
Fable,"Took advantage of some business associates being in town to try out this place - I live around the corner and keep walking past. I was impressed with the selection of microbrews on tap, and the cocktail menu had some great looking drinks. 

We started with the chickpea fritters which were great to share, and then moved on our mains. My guests were visiting from Toronto, so they obviously went with the smoked salmon, and had nothing but great things to say about it. 

As for myself, being a vegetarian, there were limited options for entrees, but the eggplant parmesan was hands down one of the tastiest meals I have had in Vancouver to date. Usually Vancouver restaurants pass off a bowl of $20 pasta in a cream sauce, or some lame $18 roasted veggies as an acceptable vegetarian entree, which is absolute bullshit, so having a thoughtful, artful, vegetarian entree was a breath of fresh air. I was so convinced they had mixed up the mushroom bolognese with beef that I had to ask the server to check it out. 

At the end of the meal a gentleman who I assumed was the owner came out and assured me that it was a mushroom sauce, and thanked us for coming in. Great food, great service, great atmosphere, will definitely return."
Fable,"Fable was opened by Top Chef Runner up Trevor Bird in May of this year. Like a few of the great new restaurants opening up around Vancouver, Fable is all about delivering delicious locally sourced food - from farm to table. I love the name!

I have been meaning to dine here for quite some time, but as a West Ender, I don't venture out to Kitsilano as often as I should. One Saturday during the move, Jake and I decided to treat ourselves to a delicious brunch out and so Fable it was!

Upon walking into Fable, you feel instantly relaxed and comfortable. It's rustic, warm, and not pretentious feeling in the slightest. I feel like that's quite rare these days with all the new hip joints opening up. The seating area is open creating a nice social barn-like atmosphere. The servers are dressed in button up shirts adding to the immaculate rustic theme. 

I ordered the Scrambled Eggs: Curtis' brioche, rosti - Walter's eggs, Sautéed spinach/bacon, and parmesan. 4.5 stars.
The eggs were delicious, prepared really well, and served in a little mason jar topped with bacon bits, spinach and a light parmesan foam. I cannot fault their eggs in the slightest. They were perfectly made.

The brioche was soft and fluffy as it should be. The home made strawberry jam was delightful. I will need to make my own one day. You can taste the difference with one that has come out of a jar. And the hash cake, crunchy on the outside, hashy on the inside. The yoghurt chive dollop really added to the flavour.

Jake ordered the Eggs Benedict with Olive oil Hollandaise and halibut brandade. 4.5 stars. 

The Hollandaise makes or breaks an eggs benny in my mind. Fable's hollandaise, was light, lemony and not too heavy and overpowering. It was just perfect. In saying that the dish was creamy as a whole, but again not in an overpowering way. The halibut cake was subtle, but a preferred alternative to a heavy salmon.

To top off the meal we received two home-made cranberry white chocolate cookies. Not the best cookie I've had to be fair, but it was a cute freebie.

I am desperate to come back to Fable for their dinner service, which I hear is casual with fine dining service. Also worth noting that their latte was one of the best I've had in Vancouver - and for a Kiwi that's saying a lot.

Price $$ | Service 5 | Atmosphere 4.5 | Overall 4.5
Review by Crumb Fight http://crumbfight.com/fable-from-farm-to-table/"
Fable,"Went there with a party of 5 which included 3 x 11 yr old boys and two moms.  (school strike day!)   Fantastic service, and even better food.   Boys loved their food and as did the adults-- the chickpea critters especially were quite delightful.   Boys had specially  kind words for the lemonade and grilled cheese sandwich.  Very friendly staff and love how the owner makes an effort to come talk to the diners.    Overall great experience-- exactly what you want as a dining out experience. We made it into a day-trip from North Vancouver and it was worth the drive and then some!"
Fable,"Entrees ordered:

Steak frites: steaks were well seasoned and cooked to order perfectly! Sides were OK. Nothing special but not bad. They served it on what they called a blackberry jam sauce but honestly tasted like Asian black bean sauce...

Buttermilk rabbit (feature meal; not on standard menu): 
Very tasty rabbit but 2/3 people who ordered it wished it was cooked differently. 

Note: general consensus of our group was that the potato wedges were not that great and definitely could've been done better. 

Service:

Excellent service! Very friendly and knowledgeable - never ran out of water! Food was served pretty quickly which worked well for us"
Fable,"I have been to Fable twice- once for dinner and once for a weekend brunch.  Dinner was great- food is good and service is attentive.  Brunch was okay and the service was stupendous.  I went with my 3 friends, 2 children and a baby.  It was very family friendly.  The server/manager saw that the kids were getting restless so she brought over some colouring books and small toys to occupy the boys.  Make sure your entire party is there as they wont seat you until all have arrived.  I would go back for dinner though it is a bit on the pricier end.  I guess that's the price to pay for farm to table (local?) food."
Fable,This is a wonderful paddock to plate style restaurant. The staff were really friendly and there was really fast service. The food is delicious and you can tell that it is all fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone In the area.
Fable,"I must be missing something here cuz I read the reviews before we went but didn't have the same experience. The staff is awesome, professional, the kitchen looks like it's under control and clean and knowledgeable but I didn't find the food memorable. We went for lunch and there wasn't much on the menu. We got a sandwich and tomato soup and something else that I can't even remember. Great staff but boring food, I can't even remember what we had. Sorry guys, won't be going back."
Fable,"Overpriced and undernourished! Crowded cafe style dining with a limited pretentious menu, small portions at exorbitant prices with average service. I never thought that Vancouverites could be so undiscerning in their dining..."
Fable,"I think this is my favorite restaurant ever, they never disappoint!  We've always been a fan and LOVE the canned tuna, I would order 10 of these and eat only that for dinner if I could, but I'd probably get some weird stares...Most recently we came here for their Valentine's special menu.  It was amazing as usual.  Every dish that came was absolutely delicious, my guy practically hogged the sablefish entree and he doesn't even normally like fish!  The only thing I wish they would do is to bring back the lemon parfait dessert.  I loved that thing, please make it again!"
Fable,"GO!! YOURE MISSING OUT!

My boyfriend and I came here for a quick dinner. The food...is incredible. I ordered the chicken with risotto and he ordered the steak frites and i can tell you that we inhaled the food and almost licked the plates.

On top of that, we received our food within 10 minutes of ordering (i don't even know how they made such savoury and gourmet meals that fast).

This is one of my new favourite spots!

Food- Excellent..top notch, delicious
Service- really knowledgable servers and fast service
Ambience- Its a perfect mix of modern/trendy/cozy/upscale/laid back

love it!!!"
Fable,One of my favourite Vancouver restaurants. Have been here a number of times - I always love the canned tuna. You can definitely bring your kids here too - at least I do. =)
Fable,"This was probably the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Attentive, fast, helpful, friendly. We didn't have to wait at all; we were brought in and served immediately. We both ordered the steak frites medium rare and got exactly that. The fries were hot and crispy. Didn't care too much for the brown steak sauce -  reminded me of marmite though my husband thought it was like black bean sauce. The beef tasted fresh though my steak was a little chewy. Still had room for dessert. Had the lemon meringue parfait based on the server's recommendation - it was OK but wouldn't get it again. My husband thought his Dolce de Leche cheesecake was OK but he wouldn't get it again either. Overall, 4 stars for food, 5 stars for ambiance, 5+ stars for service. The bill came to $79."
Fable,"I haven't been here for dinner yet, but I've been here for brunch about 5 times, and it's AMAZING!
Basically, if Fable was a celebrity, it'd be Mila Kunis; it's classy, down to Earth, unique, and a taste of something new!  
I suggest the benny for brunch, and don't forget one of their freshly squeezed mimosas!  
How good was the service?  I tipped 35%, and I'm usually cheap!  That's how awesome it is there!"
Fable,Perfect meal. Sit at the bar and drink and eat with Ben the bartender. Take his word for it. Excellent meal! Smoked duck!!! Maple cake!!! Divine!!! Enjoy!!
Fable,"We came here for our bi-annual staff lunch. A first time for many of us at Fable. I arranged reservations in advance through Kathy  and she was extremely helpful working with our large party and limited budget in advance.  
We were served chickpea fritters and the canned tuna as an appetizer - both delicious!
The entrees were all fantastic as well. Between the grilled cheese, pasta tagliatelle, gluten-free tagliatelle (with zucchini pasta), and burger, everyone really enjoyed their meals. The food was presented beautifully and the service was prompt, cheerful, and professional. Thanks to all the folks at Fable for making our little celebration so enjoyable and easy!"
Fable,"I came here a few weeks back on a Saturday for brunch. I went at opening so the lines were not too crazy. The hostess was able to seat us relatively quickly. I had the ""stew"" it was interesting, quite tasty but not amazing. One of us had a benny which was not bad as well. We had some complimentary cookies at the end of the meal. The service was great, but the food didn't blow me away."
Fable,"My girlfriend and I went to this place for dinner on Friday night. When we arrived, we were nicely greet by our hostess and we were sat near the back of the restaurant. That night, I found the dinning room was hot and I guess the heat must came from the kitchen or the air conditioning was not turn on. From the menu, we ordered the Duck wings special, the Duck Breast and the Scallop Special. The Duck wings special was a pretty interesting appetizer and its was basically deep fried duck wing, duck neck and duck hearts. It tasted pretty good, perfectly cooked wings with BBQ sauce. As for the Duck Breast dish, it's debatable to my tastes. The duck was greatly well prepared, the meat was juicy and moist. However, the quinoa side dish was not my cup of tea. The quinoa, nut and dried cherries mixed side dish was too empowering to the simple duck breast and it makes the meat like the side dish instead. As for the scallop special, it was well done, perfectly cooked scallop with blended corn butter sauce. Overall, the dishes were well presented but I think the price was a little high vs. the portion size of the dishes. I may try tem again for a special occasion"
Fable,Can be hit and miss depending on what you choose. All appys are yummy but sometimes the mains aren't as good.
Fable,"Not a negative word to say about my experience or the food. I had a fried trout with carrot puree and roast vegetables with a green salad. So clean, so much yum. Can't wait to try more :)"
Fable,"This was SUCH an incredible dining experience. My parents were visiting in town and I had heard incredible things about Fable. Booked a reservation for 6:30, and were instantly seated when we walked in.
Our server was knowledgeable (almost overly so), friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. He recommended the chickpea fritters and the canned tuna. Both were INCREDIBLE. My dad did point out that he expected the tuna to be raw, and it came out cooked. I thought it was delicious and would've been just as good the other way. Also, the sauce that came with the chickpea fritters was divine. 
I ordered the gnocchi with the pulled pork, after hearing the high praise from our server. I can honestly say that this was one of the best dishes I've ever had at any restaurant. The mix of the perfectly cooked vegetables, the pillowy and soft gnocchi and the absolutely incredible pulled pork was just to die for. My mom ordered the butcher's cut, which was the flat-iron steak and my dad had the pasta special that night, which came with bacon and a few other mixed veg on top. Both were so impressed, and my parents are incredibly hard to please when it comes to restaurants. 
THANK YOU to Fable for a wonderful and unforgettable dining experience. Can't wait to come back for the next special occasion!!"
Fable,"Had dinner and drinks with my friends and had great time. Everything we ate was so good. I had the spaghetti and meatballs for appy and the chicken for my main. Service, atmosphere, and food all 4 star. I will be back."
Fable,"On vacation from the East Coast and had dinner here due to Yelp reviews.  First off I want to say that the service was excellent.  Everyone was very friendly, helpful, attentive and was 5 star.  The 2 star rating was more for the food.  

There was 4 in our party and we each ordered something different to get a taste of as many items as possible.  For appetizers we ordered the Canned Tuna, Chickpea Fritters and Flatbread. The Canned Tuna was too sweet for my taste and overwhelmed the subtleness of tuna...more jam than tuna.  The Chickpea Fritters were okay but nothing special as I have eaten a lot of falafels at half the price.  Overall it was not special enough be an elevated, deconstructed falafel.  The Flatbread was okay, again, nothing special outside of the nice crispy pork belly chunk.  For our main course we had the duck breast, potato wrapped chicken, salmon and steak frites.  I had the duck breast, medium rare, and the problem was that the fat between the skin and flesh was not rendered.  I love crispy duck skin but the skin was underdone, soft and with the raw fat it was inedible.  I had to cut off the fat and skin to only eat the duck flesh thereby rendering it only half an entree in my opinion as the skin is a key component of having a duck breast entree.  The potato wrapped chicken was disappointing as the potato around the chicken was a dense 1/8 - 1/4 inch layer of tasteless potato.  Overall the dish was bland.  The Steak Frites was skirt steak and it was tasty but the portion was smaller than expected.  It came with mushrooms on top of a spicy hoisin sauce, interesting.  My eleven year old son had the salmon and he thought it was too ""lemony"" on some bites but I had some and didn't have any issues.  

Overall the food was average but given the price paid and expectations from all the excellent reviews it was a disappointing dinner.  As I said before, the service was great and the waitress came by a couple of times and asked how everything was giving us ample opportunity to mention these issues.  Maybe the duck was correctable but the others were what it was so we left it alone and just nodded that things were good."
Fable,"Came here last night with my girlfriend for our Anniversary with a reservation for 8pm. ( I'd suggest making a reservation at least a day in advance for late weekend nights) The place was packed and happening. The hostess greeted us with a ""happy Anniversary"" and seated us right on time. Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable of the products and not pushy at all with our drink purchases. We ended up ordering the chick pea fritters and canned tuna to start. The chick pea fritters were absolutely phenomenal wow! the combination of the curry sauce and red onions were to die for and something to come back for alone. I was a little sceptical on the canned tuna since I am really not a fan of cooked or even warm fish but this mixture of ingredients works so well for me. It's hard to explain really, but the fish isn't cooked...but the mini mason jar it's served in is warmed in water (i believe) and wow it was great and I think I had more of it than my girlfriend even though she's the fish eater between us two. 

For mains she had the squash gnocchi with pulled pork and she was astounded calling the gnocchi ""like eating little clouds"" and also saying the pulled pork was the best she has ever had in her entire life and I concurred with both. I got the duck breast and cheese perogies  and after the first bite, I was almost in tears of how delicious it was. Our server had suggested getting the duck medium rare or medium depending on your taste and said if you get it medium it's a bit chewy. I got it medium and it was perfect though she was correct about the little bit of chewiness. Everything about this dish screamed "" I am the best thing you have ever eaten!!"" and that scream was absolutely spot on.  

The price for our meal was expected before coming in so it didn't bother us at all and believe me, it was worth every penny. The one thing that sorta sucked for us was that we were too full for desert but then it was also a good thing because we thoroughly enjoyed every bite, but next time we are coming for you smores desert! 

We will be back for sure."
Fable,"This review comes months late but 3 months after my first visit my boyfriend and I have decided to come back here for our 5 year anniversary so I think that says how much we love this place.

It's a small size restaurant in Kits where ReFuel used to be. It gets very busy and loud inside, apparently there are lineups to get in now. They take limited reservations by email, so do email them if you don't want to risk standing out in the rain. Another tip - ask to sit by the bar! I normally would not have been excited for this having worked in a restaurant kitchen before so I was expecting it to be super hot and hectic. However, the chefs were all calm; it's so cool watching how they work and the attention they put into plating. Chef Trevor also likes to go out and have a talk with the bar patrons when it's not too busy. I admit, I was rooting for him to take the Top Chef title so I was a little star struck meeting him but he is a very chill guy to talk to and you can tell how passionate he is about the food and that he really cares what you think  about their food (good or bad).

For the food - bread is not complimentary but we decided to get the house made rosemary bread ($4). Good bread, fresh, you can really taste the rosemary and it's nice to get that bite of sea salt. Just not sure if I would get it again. For the mains, we had the duck breast ($24) and eggplant parmesan and mushroom bolognese ($18). The eggplant parm was very good and perfectly crispy, the pasta was al dente and the mushroom bolognese was very flavourful. The winner of the night was the duck breast! So moist and juicy and it went well with the accompaniments. We actually got the last one for the night so it seems like a very popular dish. We ended off with the daily sweet bites ($10) which were white chocolate macadamia cookies, pavlova with a blueberry compote and macarons. I wanted to get this because the judges raved so much about Chef Curtis' macarons but I don't like desserts that are too sweet so the macarons and pavlova were much too sweet for my liking. My boyfriend who is the biggest sweet tooth loved them though. 

The meal with 3 glasses of wine came out to a little over $100. It's not a place I would go to often because of the price but definitely good once in a while for a treat. Great food but casual and unpretentious."
Fable,"Had been there before for brunch. Was always a 4 star brunch but nothing that would spur me to review. Went for diner. Had the gnocchi. Wow, that was some tasty gnocchi. Waitress took her sweet hipster time getting to us so we flagged someone else down, he was a great waiter. Wish I would have gotten his name. He was a great waiter, not to in your face, no pissy face, perfect with some delicious gnocchi."
Fable,"Hands down a 5 star rating. I went for the first time for brunch with a friend. It was very busy but we arrived before the line up started, which I'm grateful for. The decor is pleasant and even with the restaurant being full it wasn't 'too' loud. Our server, Whitney, was just delightful. Never in my life have I had such stellar customer service. Every time she walked by her tables, she eyed up the drinks to ensure everyone had water and coffee, without interrupting. I had the duck confit salad with braised kale, poached eggs and potatoes. It was just delicious. If Whitney had cleared my plate as soon as I put my fork down, I might have just ordered another one. Who knew kale could taste that good! 

I'll definitely be back.

**Update - while I haven't been back yet, said friend and I had brunch at a new restaurant every month for 2015. We recently reviewed our year and Fable topped both of our lists for favourite brunch! That's basically a gold star - congrats Fable ;)"
Fable,"Fantastic Canadian cuisine! Really impressed! Loved the ambiance, service, food, and wine list. I have been here twice now, only for brunch mind you, but both times it was an absolute delight!"
Fable,"The food is creative and unique, but the service is what really impressed me. The staff is so helpful and friendly. I love any restaurant that has a non-alcoholic menu in addition to their cocktails. Yummy in-house sodas! Fable was the best meal I had during my stay in Vancouver."
Fable,"We were there for dinner late last week.  The place is nice and when we sat down and were handed the menu, frankly I was expecting more...was I ever wrong.  The menu descriptions seem rustic but the food was fantastic.  We ordered and shared the canned tuna (based on the reviews),  the spagetti & meatballs and the gnocchi.  Flavors were great and ingredients were fresh.  This is a place I would visit again!"
Fable,"I don't really understands the hype and good reviews. 

My bf took me there for my bday dinner couple weeks ago. The food were barely ok. The Main dishes are so bad! I don't like complaining at restaurants unless it has hair in it or something. So I didn't complain. 

Fresh oyster 4 stars
2 other appy we got is not too bad. 3 stars
Corn bread is good. 
1 bottle of White wine (not cold enough) 2 star. 

Main dish
Sable fish. 2 star (my bf's rating)
My chicken dish 1 star!! It so dry and boring. It's like eating cardboard. The Ratatouille is good, but can't save the dish. 

Desert just ok"
Fable,Delicious! Awesome service! Great menu and well priced! I high key recommend this little Kitsalano  treasure. Took some friends there from out of town - sampled much of the menu and we all thoroughly enjoyed our time!
Fable,"Fable makes food that I could eat every day for the rest of life. Okay, maybe not literally every day for the rest of my life, but what I mean is that this is the kind of food I love - simple, clean, truthful.... I want to leave a restaurant feeling joyful and satisfied (not stuffed) knowing that I spent my hard-earned money on a meal that was thoughtfully prepared and that is what I got at Fable. My trout was lovely (pickled mushrooms - yes please!) and the gnudi was delicious!! And get a macaron or three! Fabulous service, fair prices, overall wonderful meal/experience."
Fable,Literally everything on the brunch menu looked amazing. I went with the farmer's muffin and was not disappointed. Now I just have to go back 18 more times to try out the rest.
Fable,"I was not impressed by the brunch a month ago, things were overly flavoured (too salty, too sweet...) and nothing really stood out, but I decided this place needed a 2nd try and I LOVED dinner tonight.  I opted for two appetizers instead of a main, had the canned tuna (no joke, best ""canned"" tuna I've ever had), and the spaghetti & meatballs (duck meat ball + tagliatelle), a dish Trevor made on Top Chef.  Both dishes were outstanding. I'm personally a huge fan of the canned tuna. 

Trevor must have been off enjoying the BC day long weekend, but Curtis was there doing a wonderful job holding down the fort.  Ate at the bar and got to chat with Curtis and the rest of the crew. Friendly, attentive service throughout.  I'd definitely go back again, but would probably stick with dinner only.  (All night, I watched plates and plates of the duck breast and potato crusted chicken ratatouille, if I were to try a main, I'd definitely give the chicken a try, I rarely see chicken dishes at restaurants that tempt me, this one looked promising, of course, I don't think you can go wrong with the duck either.)

I had the peach melba for dessert to wrap up. On a warm evening in Vancouver, you can't really go wrong with a deliciously poached peach with vanilla ice cream + raspberry sorbet!"
Fable,"This place was amazing!  We were staying on Granville Island and just looked up places for brunch and were lucky enough to find Fable. We wanted to take a little morning walk so it seemed perfect and it was. Great food, unique cocktails and stellar service. Highly recommended!"
Fable,"Went there for brunch and it was totally overrated. Luckily the wait time was fairly quick. The service and ambiance were good, but the food was nothing special and the portion size and value were really lacking. Three egg omelet...I think not. We found the flavors totally unbalanced; everything was too sweet despite the fact that all of us ordered savory dishes. The condiments, sauces, jams, that were served alongside the johnny cakes, sausage, scrambled eggs were so sweet and overpowered everything. 

Do yourself a favor and go to The Oakwood or Cafe Medina instead."
Fable,"I really like their service here and fairly priced brunch for weekend! Hooray! The service is very genuine and super friendly. They don't take reservation for brunches and the line up can get long very fast. You gotta come early and score a table! The price is so reasonable for brunch pretty much most of the menu is under $15. Who wants to pay over $20 for a brunch!  I love the homey wooden decor, it's cozy and comfortable. My omelette was yummy and was generously portioned. The server comes around with coffee so your cup is never empty for so long. I would love to come back for some casual brunch on weekends."
Fable,"Fable, all I can say is, ""where have you been all my life?!"" A friend and I went for brunch at your adorable Kits location a couple of weeks ago and it was aaah-mazing. The food was innovative, fresh and delicious and the staff were standout friendly and knowledgeable. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu! :)"
Fable,"The atmosphere was great and very welcoming, considering the rain and wind outside. We got here right at evening opening on a Sunday and were seated right away. It definitely did get busy so I would recommend a reservation for larger parties. Their menu is pretty ""limited"" but with quite a lot of daily specials, there's a good amount of choice. I ordered the BC salmon while my friend had the duck confit (from the daily specials) and we ended with the S'mores. Everything was great. I'm not normally a fan of salmon but this was really tender and paired with some interesting sides (beet foam?) that worked really well. The duck was flavorful, especially the skin was crispy and delightful. Servers are attentive, food came out fast, only improvement would be wifi connection (currently very unstable)."
Fable,"really good food, has a different feel to it. It's not one of those big restaurants but rather a cozy one, slightly pricy but had good experience all the times I have been there. Will definitely recommend to other people."
Fable,Went with a group of friends in the same club and tried some of their sandwiches for lunch. the food was good and the service was great. We appreciated how they were able to accommodate so many people (we had almost 20) and the portion sizes were spot on. Would like to try macarons someday here after seeing one of the owners on top chef Canada.
Fable,"Hubby booked this surprise dinner for us and what a great surprise! A special event 'reunion' dinner with past Top Chefs Canada!! We began with Chef Dennis Tay's arroz caldo, something of a deconstructed dumpling to start and it was delicious! The dough was a little bit over cooked but otherwise, flavors were right on. Second course was chef Nicole Gomes skuna bay Salmon, which was my favorite, you had to try it! Next was chef Danny Smiles molokhia, a seared duck, fresh pasta, pickled shallots and chicken chicharron. The pasta was perfectly cooked as was the duck, the beet butter brought everything together in the chicken chicharron. Fourth course by chef Geoff Rogers, was a beef short rib cooked perfectly tender with a pepper jelly (to die for) and popcorn with vegetable resin, can't explain it but think of fluffy flavored white powdery snow flakes! Last but not least, chef and owner Trevor Birds to is bean ice cream, which your choice of toppings, made table side with fresh milk infused with tonka bean that tastes like vanilla but with a cinnamony spicey edge to it! Yummy o!! I'll be back to support our local chef and hope you do too! Quaint farm inspired decor, super friendly and knowledgable staff and Trevor is a great guy too!! I'll be back for another one of these events for sure!!"
Fable,love their concept and that they smoke their meat in the back of the restaurant!  They also have bees on the roof.  Amazing!  Good food and it just feels good to support local.
Fable,"Fable completely lives up to the hype!

Terrific food and incredible service. I don't try to be difficult customer, but sometime it happens and Fable's floor staff accommodated us brilliantly."
Fable,"Making a reservation on Twitter, what a smashing idea!  Very interesting and innovative cuisine choices (yah, I said cuisine).  I'll definitely be back, actually, this Sunday for their Boozey Brunch."
Fable,"Awful, awful, awful.

Service was great.

There were basic problems with our main course, like too much salt (!) on the steak and over-sweetened sour cream.

But the main problem was the 'refreshing key lime' dessert: it was the sweetest, grossest thing I've ever had. And it's topped off with a mound of merengue. I've had key lime pie at truck stops that tasted equivalently: but this thing was $12 a pop!
It must have been easily 1000+ calories.

No thanks."
Fable,"Love this brunch place! Came here for the first time in September and planned a return trip to Vancouver, mostly to come here again. (We're from Seattle.) Recommend the eggs benedict. And be sure to try the coffee. Delicious food, cute space, friendly service. Be prepared to wait at least 45+ minutes outside (no waiting room). Oh, and it goes get quite loud in the dinning room. But who cares when you're eating delicious things!"
Fable,"I can't even explain how much I loved EVERYTHING here. I am a loyal lover of L'abbatoir but I think I might've moved on! Just kidding, they're both equally amazing but I loved every single dish I've had a Fable.
I ordered the canned tuna, duck & pork for entree, and oh gee that lemon meringue is so delicious! I can't wait for my next visit here!

P.s. the service here is lovely, everyone is so sweet!"
Fable,"We popped in on a whim on a Thursday night with no reso and decided to wait the 20 minutes to try this restaurant we had heard so much about.  I'm glad we did - so worth the wait!  We were seated at the bar so we could see the kitchen at work.  The chicken entree is AMAZING!  I have never tasted such moist chicken.  It wasn't just ""not dry"" - it was realy moist and tasty.  And the lemon meringue parfait was to die for.  I would highly recommend BOTH dishes!  Service was great and friendly."
Fable,I had a chance to try their lunch and I have to say it was very delicious. Ingredients looked fresh and well prepared.I am looking forwrad in trying their dinner soon.
Fable,"One of my favourite restaurants! Not only does it allow me to gawk at Trevor Bird from afar but it never disappoints when it comes to the food. 

I had the duck meatball and when you cut into it the juice spills out and provides a flavourful sauce to the pasta. 

The entrees are all really well prepared and I have a weakness for their dessert sampler. 

The restaurant itself is a little crowded but the food and service make it worth it. 

I am so happy for Fable's success and hope it continues to grow!"
Fable,"We have eaten at fable a number of times now and I am finally posting a review as I think I have a good sense of whether this is a good restaurant or not. 

Generally speaking, the food is delicious. However, there have been moments where the dishes weren't as tasty as I would have liked them to be considering he price. Here is a list of what I have tried:

Good:
1. Chickpea fritters - very well balanced, love the mild curry taste
2. S'mores - had this twice now, love the homemade ice cream
3. Trout with carrot purée and kale - just the right size
4. Tomato risotto - super filling
5. Duck breast - again, well balanced
6. Scallops (march 2014) - a tad heavy on the cauliflower, but still super yummy
7. Pancakes (kids menu) - by far the best pancakes I have ever tasted, they are thin and chewy, which is what I prefer
8. Fable eggs - the tomato jam is to die for
9. Fable-tini - speaks for itself

Not so good:
1. Spaghetti with meatball - have had this a couple of times and twice it was super salty! 
2. Lemon meringue - omg, too sweet!
3. Beetroot tartare - was totally not worth it for $13, the brown chips were like cardboard, super weird
4. Scallops (nov 2013) - the combination of the flavours was not good
5. Canned tuna - a lot of people rave about this, but I found the texture of the tuna quite odd
6. Duck basket - I would expect something similar in a Chinese restaurant
7. Rabbit (specials board) - the meal came out cold

I am giving them 3.5/4 stars because of the inconsistency. For the prices they charge, the food better be good!"
Fable,"The salmon tar tar tasted amazing, me and my family loved every second of it.
Hope others may find this review useful :) 
Don't forget the desert either, especially the french toast"
Fable,"Had avocado salmon toast, was very good. There's a line and it's super busy so I guess a lot of people enjoy this place. The wait to get in and the wait to get food was a little long, but I guess that's the price of popularity."
Fable,"The wait was a bit long, but once you're inside, it is well worth the wait! I had a drink called ""kiss of a rose"", and it was amazing. Is go back here again!"
Fable,"We stayed for 4-nights in the Kitsilano neighborhood and wanted farm-to-table food in a down-to-earth atmosphere (we were missing home just a little bit at this point).  Our reservation was for 9pm but we showed up at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, were seated right away and picked a table with some privacy.  I admired the exposed brick, beams and asked about the art/photography from local artist, Kyla Brown (www.kylabrown.com).  The menu had several seasonal dishes with great wine pairing suggestions.  We had happy hour before arriving so we ordered entrees.  I opted for the smoked duck breast with pea puree and fresh pea shoots paired with Rose.  The hubs tried the sous-vide steak with shiitake mushrooms and bok choy salad.  Both dishes were bold and beautiful!  The reason for the 4-stars was due to my hubs dislike for sous-vide, he loves steak but after trying this style cooking for the first time he realized he prefers the old fashioned way of grilling.  We saved room for dessert because while we waited for the host to set up our table, I was watching the dessert chef make a rhubarb crumble parfait.  I can never say no to rhubarb.  This farm-to-table is so fresh we witnessed the delivery of food items for the next day and if you still don't believe me, ask to see the beehives on the roof of the restaurant!  Thank you for a great date night, Chef Trevor and staff!"
Fable,"This restaurant is simply amazing. On our arrival we received a warm welcome. The atmosphere was friendly and we liked the set up the set up of the restaurant. The staff very patiently helped us with the menu. Every thing about the food (starter, main, and dessert) was great and delicious. On top of the great food we were really impressed by the nice, friendly, and patient attitude of the staff during our rather long stay. Thank you Fable - this was a wonderful experience and memorable evening. We will certainly come back."
Fable,One of my all time favourite restaurants.  Usually go for their special but cant go wrong w anything...might take you a while to get off your seat after dessert - YUM!
Fable,"Had a few applies and drinks with my girl. Try the spaghetti and meatballs and canned tuna for sure... And, probably get an order of corn bread as well."
Fable,"Solid offerings and friendly staff. The food is fresh, delicious and creative. The drinks ain't too shabby either. I like this place for friendly gatherings, might be a bit too noisy and casual for a date, but if you are there to enjoy good food then you can't go wrong here."
Fable,The scrambled eggs are wonderfully smoky and moist.  It didn't seem like a lot of food but it filled me up and I sauntered home for a nap.  The toast and potatoes were perfect as well.  I will be returning for sure.
Fable,"It has always been easy for me to talk about Fable. While I talk about it a lot, I have never actually written about it (save on Twitter). I am essentially reviewing what has quickly become one of my favourite places to be in Vancouver. As such, I try to support the restaurant the best way I can: by visiting again and again... and again. I love the restaurant for its vision, food and service.

Fable's vision is a lofty one in a world where the easy road leads to too much processed food in restaurants. The restaurant doesn't swing that way. It uses the best ingredients from local sources. It can't be more farm to table cuisine than by Chef Trevor Bird building a menu that includes appetizers like house made breads, canned tuna, and, my personal favourite, chickpea fritters. If that's not enough, the mains range from fish (the salmon may have been the best dinner I've ever had there), to 'P Gnocchi' one of the best balanced vegetarian options I've seen on a menu. By providing such amazing ingredients in his menu's dishes, Bird proves that you can eat incredibly balanced food that is found in and outside the city. By following his farm to table vision, Bird proves that food from farms and gardens taste way better than that processed food, thereby taking the harder road with, ultimately, greater reward.

What a reward it is, too. The food that Bird, Rogers and the rest of the brigade prepare night after night is incredibly balanced. This is pretty big. A dish being seasoned perfectly is a big deal. Through lunches, dinners, brunches (and the once a month boozy brunch), the food prepared is simply astounding. Moreover, when you add the nightly features written on their chalkboard (most likely to be eaten up by the dinner crowd, sometimes even before 7 pm!), the oft-changing menu is a guest's foodie dream. I could list all of my favourites, but they might not be on the menu next time (case in point, the steelhead trout they had was amazing, replaced with an equally delicious salmon dish). There are certain mainstays though (chickpea fritters and the much-discussed canned tuna). Every dinner at Fable provides an indelible eating experience, whether it was the night I had the bread pudding for dessert, or the first time eating the heirloom tomato salad, or even that time I nearly licked the plate after eating the P Gnocchi. The list just goes on and on, not unlike the brilliant chefs that, night after night, prepare the best meals in Vancouver.

In order for those prepared meals to arrive, however, the plates need to make their way to the kitchen wood, bar or table. Which is where the genuinely accomplished servers fit in at the restaurant. Frankly, I could write about the staff as much as the food. I always think of them as superhuman in that they are the most genuinely intuitive restaurant staff I've met in my life. It sounds hyperbolic of me to say, I know, but when you watch someone be on the phone fixing a problem with the credit card machine AND, at the same time, putting garnish on the rosti on eight plates in an extremely busy brunch service, you'd agree with me. Alana, Tina, Jordan, Nick, and the rest of the servers don't seem to stop, and still somehow make everything better in the restaurant. These men and women are intuitive to the needs of the guests, they know the menu, and they are just incredible people overall. In addition to the servers, there is also Georgina and the rest of the host staff, who are clearly rock stars in the restaurant as well. Considering the sheer volume of people that come in and out every day, it always amazes me that Georgina's attitude is as bright and sunny from beginning to end. Lastly, I also wanted to make one last mention of the co-owners with Trevor. Ron and Kathy know how to run restaurants. I can't begin to describe how amazing they are at their jobs, and, all while having kids of their own. Talk about superhuman. I honestly don't know how this generous, capable and dependable duo do it.

However, they, like everyone else that works at Fable,  do it. They get the work done with every service. I couldn't be more happy having a restaurant this good in Kitsilano, or, this proud to see such great people succeed in Vancouver. When you get a chance, go to Fable for the food, and then stay for the experience."
Fable,"Excellent wine, excellent food and very good service. Farm to table done right! Order the gnocchi, canned tuna (i know it sounds weird), meatball (tagliatelle) and the butchers cut steak. Can't go wrong with any of them!"
Fable,"Recently went to Fable with some friends from New York, they loved it, felt it was as good as any they'd visit at home. Their only complaint were the modest cocktail sizes. Canned Tuna and chickpea fritters were highlights."
Fable,"I had the trout, it was fantastic! Crispy kale with it was a perfect compliment. Canned tuna & beet salad were also very good. The parfait was a little too sweet for me. I'd come here again for sure."
Fable,All other reviewers said it best. Nothing more to add. One of the finest places to eat in Vancouver.
Fable,great brunch and great vibe.  their breakfast brunches are delicious. i'm a big fan.
Fable,"The three stars conform to the Yelp rating system, where three stars = ""A-OK."" This describes perfectly my experience of Fable. By no means was it bad. But it wasn't great, either. It was a solid, plain, uninspired 'good.'

The space is that weird long room on 4th & Cypress that has never housed a successful restaurant. I think there used to be an Asian fusion place there, then maybe a crepes place, then a burger joint? Inside, through a long, cramped hallway, the dining area opens up. It's dimly lit & homey, with wood panelled walls. The accent wall is a blackboard covered in a chalk mural. It's all very cute, but for the dumb light boxes on the accent wall. These feature meaningless word-slaw aphorisms about looking into one's heart & finding lost time (or some such), & seem to have been purchased from LuLuLemon's garage sale. These stupid light boxes irritated me because their inclusion is clearly intended to soothe the Kits yoga droids who are frightened by the hipster decor. Every time I looked up from my meal, there were the light boxes, glowing with smug complacency, imposing an irritating gnostic philosophy on a space that was otherwise relaxed & open to interpretation. An otherwise homey & comfortable room made totally cheap. A real shame.

Our server was very friendly & knowledgeable. When my friend told her about her gluten blah blah blah, the server knew her stuff & checked with the kitchen about anything that gave her pause. I was informed that they were just getting their cocktails sorted out & didn't have a menu as such, but could likely make anything standard. Well, maybe anything but a Manhattan. Mine was, uh... well, it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't anywhere near a Manhattan. Now, I won't be too critical because the cocktail menu was clearly in flux, but did they only have limited ingredients or something? Because that's really the only excuse for what I received. I could taste dry vermouth (not sweet) in there, but no rye & definitely no bitters. I don't know what the other ingredients were, but they amounted to a khaki-coloured drink that was served in a martini glass & garnished with nothing (as opposed to a brown drink served in a tumbler & garnished with a maraschino cherry).

Now, again, we're dealing with a cocktail bar that is obviously in transition, but part of that transition would really benefit from a book of bog-standard cocktail recipes. Or asking the person working bar to download one of the ten zillion free cocktail recipe apps onto their smartphone. Or just coming back & telling me that the person behind the bar has no idea what a Manhattan is & asking me if I'd like something else, & recommending that I just stick to the wine list. Hint: stick to the wine list.

The food: it was good. I was happy to pay for it. But it wasn't great, & it wasn't very memorable. My friend had the obnoxiously-named ""urban salad"" (beyond the senseless name, when we're talking fresh produce, I don't want connotations of urbanity, thanks). I had the canned tuna, which was a cute idea (albacore tuna & lemon & potatoes in oil in a little mason jar), & which tasted nice. The lemon was very overpowering, though, & the tuna was pretty sparse - two chunks about the size of quarters.

My friend's main was the salmon, which I didn't sample, but it seemed to involve a lot of green. She said that it was 'nice.' My main was the feature, which that night was pork shoulder & some kind of pastry stuffed with ricotta & pork. The pastry was lovely, but the pieces of pork shoulder were dry & the teaspoon of gravy & compote provided weren't enough to  enliven them.

For desert, I had a lemon thing, which, too, was 'nice.' It was clearly trying to get into molecular foodie territory, with its gin foam & lemon ice, but the combination didn't quite work for me. Every forkful just tasted like a lot of lemon. Even the tangerine slices tasted of lemon. Pretty boring.

My friend had the dessert platter which came with lots of cutesy tea-room desserts. The meringues were truly excellent. I didn't try the pink macaroons because their neon colour put me off, but my friend said there were excessively sweet.

All in all, this place is good. For Kits, which - given the other offerings in the area - is an area that doesn't know much about food, it's an absolute oasis. This is the best restaurant you'll find on that Kits strip of 4th, but that's a pretty hollow victory. The food is good, the service is lovely, the space is cute (light boxes aside), & I'm sure the cocktails will improve. But, given how much choice there is in the city, 'good' and 'nice' just aren't enough, & I'll try somewhere else before I return here. Sorry, Fable - no hard feelings."
Fable,"I found their brunch to be the standard fare. Every bite of my Benedict was delicious, the coffee strong and the service excellent. A great stop before or after some shopping in the area."
Fable,"Great restaurant, brunch was amazing and filling. But it was not cheap. $25 for an omelette and mimosa. Atmosphere is great but be prepared to wait in line for 20 minutes if you arrive around 11am on a weekend. Would I go back? Absolutely, a real classy place in Kits."
Fable,"Loved this place.  1st of all, even tho' it's super popular, my friend was still able to make reservations for 4 for 6:30 on a Saturday evening.  

The service is friendly & casual.  Didn't feel rushed or anything.  And Top Chef Trevor was in the restaurant, greeting folks, acting as food runner, etc wchich was cool.  The server advised that the appy's are generously sized for sharing (which is a nice economical tip).  We had the duck meatball & chickpea fritters - both super delish!  As for entrees, the fact that they are all in the $20-$25 range and super tasty makes the place a good deal.  I had the skirt steak - perfectly cooked to my taste & the sides/sauce were nicely balanced.  Even better was my husband's duck breast entree.  

If you go as a couple or even a single but don't have resos, they do have an open kitchen bar which would be a great place to watch the action."
Fable,"Great little spot in Kits.  Been there a bunch of time and the food and service is always great! It's a fairly small room and sometimes you have to wait, but other than that, it's great."
Fable,One of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver. Food is amazing and excellent service!
Fable,"3 things about fable:

1. the service is so friendly and attentive.  there are a lot of people working here at all times i noticed.  they've got it down.  

2. the food is impeccably executed.  wonderful flavours.  creative menu.  artful presentation.  canned tuna is a must.

3. prices are very reasonable given food quality.

so why is this just 4/5 stars?  i'm very conflicted about this place.  i want to love it.  people love this place!  i should love it too right?  but i don't love love it.  the dishes are so awesome in so many ways, but they are too complicated for my taste.  a little piece of this here, another piece of that there.  dinner, breakfast, same thing.  i like things simple.  not too much stuff going on on my plate.  i feel almost guilty for not loving it more.  like it's my fault.  i'm sorry fable.  it's not you, it's me."
Fable,"Saw the Georgia Straight Golden Plate reviews, and decided I would have to check Fable out. 

I was not disappointed in the slightest, for lunch my mother and I ordered the chickpea fritters, and the golden beat salad, both were impeccably dressed, and I would go back just for the fritters.
My mother had the shepherds pie, which she felt was slightly lackluster and I had the vegetarian tagliatelle with chorizo, and I was beyond happy with my choice. Great portion size, and very balanced set of flavours.

Service was great, not out of this world, but as a last minute lunch decision, I would definitely go back."
Fable,"I honestly have never seen Top Chef Canada but this resturant was recommended to me by a friend so I figured I would give it a try. It did not disappoint. They resturant is cozy, warm and very inviting. I called ahead to make a reservation but was told the reservation tables were full but they do save walk-in tables and they were more than able to accommodate us. The wait staff was super friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. It was cool how you can see and mostly smell everything that is going on inside the kitchen. I had started with an oyster, as I have never had one I thought no time like the present to have one. It was really tasty, granted I have nothing to compare it to. I would have another oyster, if that is saying anything.  Although there is not much on the menu for vegetarians (like my husband), I had the steak which was VERY flavorful with the black pepper jelly. My husband had the gnocchi which he said was a bit over cooked and very small in portion size. He definatley left hungry, and I could have honestly had a bit more too. 

But the food is really delicious and worth a visit."
Fable,We had tried twice to visit Fable without any luck. So I made reservations well in advance for my daughter's birthday. So of course my expectations are raised. The food was good but not stellar. But good value for Kitsilano. The service was extremely casual and seemed very inexperienced but we didn't have any major complaints. But what really got to me was that'll with such a limited menu every main course and a few starters had button mushrooms. Seemed a bit too much but perhaps only because I don't care for mushrooms. The wine list seemed pretty ordinary and expensive.
Fable,"The food is fabulous.  The service is hit and miss and there is a hint of elitism (different to the sense of pride) about the staff.  I've been here a couple of times -  the last time the waitress was friendly, attentive and bubbly, even with a full restaurant. This time the waitress (a different one) was surley, definitely not attentive, and boarderline rude - giving off an attitude that we were the last people she wanted to serve.

The menu has a good variety and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our meals - I personally would recommend the pulled pork benedict. The food and drinks come out surprisingly quickly given the demand for the place.

Had it not been for the shitty waitress who certainly didn't deserve any tip, this review would have been a bit better."
Fable,"Fable is very good, but it's missing the little things that move a restaurant from good to amazing.  

The good: The Canned Tuna is fun and in general all the fish dishes I've had there are solid.  My favorite appetizer is the duck meatball.  The desserts are truly fabulous and well worth saving room for (they were the best part of everyone's meal).  The service is also very good - the servers gave good recommendation, were very friendly and the meal was well timed.

The Disappointing: The cocktails are disappointing. They're what you might order on a patio on a summer day without food, but aren't the kinds of drinks that go well with a nice dinner.   I also not a big fan of the reservation system."
Fable,"My husband found this restaurant on someone's food blog, so we thought we'd try it out.  They use all local foods and have good relationships with the local farmers.  I had the chicken stew and my husband had the steak.  We also ordered their cheddar corn bread.  It was amazing?  Great food and great service! We're definitely going back to try their brunch too!"
Fable,"Yum yum yum. Was very excited to try out Fable. Watched top chef Canada and was happy to see some of the delicious dishes that Trevor made on the show, were on his menu. Was surprised to see Kurtis Luk also from top chef Canada in the kitchen cooking too!
We had the Canned Tuna, Chickpea fritters for appys, both were wonderful. For mains we had potato crusted chicken, slow cooked salmon and the feature of the night was a big ass super thick pork chop. The salmon was cooked perfectly, left slightly raw which is the way it should always be served, my pork chop was left just slightly pink and very juicy. Dessert was the chocolate pudding that had a walnut praline and cookie bits. 
Overall it was lovely. The staff are very attentive and friendly. Will definitely be go back for more. Next time I will try the duck meatball wearing a cheese hat on spaghetti for an appy, it came by our table and it looked so good."
Fable,"Went for a Friday lunch.  Very small menu that only consisted of 4 sandwiches and a few salads, and a daily soup.  Had the eggplant parmesan sandwich, a meatball sandwich, soup and a house salad.  Good food but the menu selection was way to small.  Didn't feel satisfied after the lunch in an odd way.  Service was very mediocre even though it wasn't that busy.  Dishes sat on the table and no water refills.  Won't make it a priority to return."
Fable,Went to Fable for the first time tonight.  My wife and I split a charcuterie platter and the slow cooked halibut which came with cumin flavoured lentils on a celeriac purée and a side of broccolini.  The service was perfect - friendly and attentive with excellent suggestions.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and the seasoning was spicy enough to be interesting but not overpowering.  I would highly recommend this place and definitely plan to return.
Fable,"WOW is all we can say about Trevor Bird and his imaginative cooking skills.  After watching every episode of Top Chef Canada with our mouths watering and often saying ""I wish I could try that""  we were thrilled to receive an email from one of our favourite Vineyards - Painted Rock inviting us to a wine food pairing dinner at Trevor's new restaurant.

We were treated to evening of at least seven courses and four of those dishes Trevor had prepared for the final at Top Chef Canada, our favourite was the olive oil poached salmon mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm my husband doesn't care for salmon and I was looking forward to helping him eat his - not a chance.   I don't think this item is one the menu currently but if/when it gets there we will be driving in from the valley bi-weekly to have some.

Our next staycation is the city is coming soon and we have plans for both brunch and a dinner at Fable.

Enjoy."
Fable,"I had a the daily special which was the duck confit salad with an egg on top. This was disappointing - duck was dry, salad lacked dressing overall not well executed. The dish that I had was definitely a miss. But I still have hope in Fables brunch and will be back to try other dishes. The service was definitely very friendly and accommodating and I like the little cookie they give you at the end."
Fable,"I heard the name was inspired by the concept ""FARM TO TABLE"". However,  I felt the name misrepresented the style of cooking.  They did a great job on plating, but the flavor of the ingredients did not come through.  The restaurant is trendy, but not worth 4.5 rating. Grub on Main St and Kits Daily Kitchen are better restaurants."
Fable,"When I woke up on a Saturday morning during Halloween weekend, it was raining. If you have ever been to this city before, you know that 'sunny', 'winter' and 'Vancouver' are rarely included in the same sentence unless 'not' is also present. I actually suspect most babies to be born with an umbrella in one hand. Therefore, the fact that it was raining was not a surprise to me but this particular morning was different: at 11am, I was to leave the house to go to Fable for a family-style restaurant with the Vancouver's Brunch Club.

What is a family-style brunch? Just for us, The owner had created a special brunch by fixing a price for trying out a little bit of everything. There was 18 of us and plenty of food to go around. We were served small portions of everything on the menu. Usually, I don't go to events where food is shared because as a pescatarian, I am limited by what I can eat and I don't want to force people to order meatless dishes, however, this brunch was at 95% meatless.

We were served small portions of:
- Salad
- scrambled eggs
If you like your scrambled eggs gooey, creamy and cheesy, then you better go to Fable as soon as possible. The cook used parmesan in his scrambled eggs and it was succulent. I happen to like my scrambled eggs that way. :)
- rosti with chive cream (potato flakes)
- eggs benedicts
I only had the smoked salmon and the halibut, but not the ham egg benedict. It was my first time trying a halibut egg benedict and I have to admit it was different, but still excellent. Fish had a bit of a creamy texture that I liked a lot.
- French toast
It was my first time being served a French toast not made from a toast. The dish was actually made with a warm piece of what looked like sponge cake with whipped cream and fruits berries. It was excellent. I am officially hooked on those French toasts.
- a piece of toast with homemade strawberry jam
The strawberry jam was not very sweet, but the bread was crispy and warm. Very nice!

At 11h30, the place was packed and I usually find it to be a good indicator of how good the food is. As a result however, our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed and made a lot of mistakes like billing errors. Either way, this did not change my opinion that the food at Fable is excellent and I would definitely go back, especially for the French Toast.

Each category is out of 5.
Food: 5/5
I am definitely going back for those French Toasts.

Service: 3/5
I took out some points because of the waitress, but it might have been a one-time thing.

Price: 4/5
Prices was 18$ for the whole brunch tax and tips included. Very fair."
Fable,"We went in for Sunday brunch, and it was incredible. We decided to sit at the bar and see what they could do behind the kitchen. Very friendly chefs, and the food can't be described in words. Go, eat, and enjoy fully."
Fable,"We had a last-minute reservation at Fable on our recent trip to Vancouver. The evening began nicely enough as we were seated, were greeted by our waiter, and placed our orders. It quickly deteriorated when the young woman bringing our bread knocked an entire glass of water into my lap. It was a cold snowy night and being drenched in icewater while dining was not in my plan. We had not ordered an appetizer, but after the water was wiped up from the floor, our table, and to some degree, my clothing, it was only moments until my salmon arrived. It was beautifully plated and I looked forward to enjoying it once my husband's meal was delivered. Unfortunately, my plate sat in front of me for 35 full minutes before his dinner arrived. In that time, a manager appeared and apologized for the situation. He explained that the tri-tip steak my husband had ordered was a new item and it had not shown up to be prepared. Our waiter did bring over an appetizer so that my husband, who is diabetic and needed to eat, would have something.  By the time his entrée arrived, mine was cold, but we made the best of it. The manager, Andy, came over to tell my husband that he would ""take care of it,"" by which we assumed he meant he would take my husband's dinner off the bill.  The food was absolutely delicious, perfectly prepared, and magnificently showcased.  We ordered a lemon meringue parfait to share for dessert and it was delicious -- Lemon curd and lemon ice cream topped with a swirl of Italian meringue.  Absolutely melted on the tongue. After our tea/coffee, we asked for the check. Our waiter brought it and the total was $0.00.  We asked for Andy and told him that we were not comfortable with this. We appreciated his offer to cover my husband's entrée, but did not feel that this was necessary.  Andy insisted that ""too many things went wrong"" to expect us to pay for the meal. We argued for a while, but finally accepted his very gracious gesture.  This is a charming, small, farm to table restaurant that deserves its outstanding and growing reputation.  We would have written a good review even had they not comped our meal!  :-)"
Fable,"Have only been here for brunch, but very tasty.. not huge portions my mother whispered to me ' i wish i got 4 strips of bacon' to which I replied 'then goto denny's'

the manager and Trevor are very nice and friendly, humble great to see from a 'celebrity chef' ..

I love the parmesan foam on the scrambled eggs!! so good.

Will definately be back to try more on the menu."
Fable,"This restaurant holds a special place in my heart.  Delicious, home-made meals made from local ingredients, a casual but upscale atmosphere...you can't go wrong for any meal of the day!  For more info and pictures, please see my food blog."
Fable,The food here is so delicious I salivate just thinking about it. Try the tuna nicoise - a taster's heaven. The chickpea fritters were amazing as was the canned tuna.
Fable,The word is out on this place. good food. good service.  now I need to make reservations :) ... or sometimes if you show up right at 5:30pm when they open you can get in as they don't book out 100% of the seats with reservations. they leave some open for walk ins which is nice.
Fable,"This place is awesome. I had the Deep Fried Duck as an appetizer. I wasn't sure what I was going to get because it was described as ""Kentucky Fried Duck"". It was ""finger licking good"" and cooked to perfection. Basically it is deep fried duck wings and necks bathed in a sweet tangy sauce with pickled onions on top. The duck was crispy and the only thing bad I can say about it was that there was too much. I was sort of full when I finished. I guess theoretically I could have stopped...what can I say the devil made me eat it all. My main course was steak frites. If you are expecting traditional steak frites think again. The potatoes, mushrooms and brocolini were cooked to perfection and covered with the steak slices. As good as the appetizer. I normally don't eat dessert but the ""devil"" whispered in my ear and I ended up eating the maple cake. It was excellent but here I had to give up halfway through because I couldn't any more. I told the chef that my experience in his restaurant beat out many of the big name places i have been to eg B&B restaurant (Batali) in Vegas, Paula Dean in Savanah, Gordon Ramsey in London....my daughter says he did not believe me.....Chef....I am not bullshitting you....you have an amazing restaurant"
Fable,I had heard nothing but great things about this placed for a few months now and thought I'd try it out for my birthday dinner this weekend. It did not disappoint! We shared the cornbread which was very tasty then I had the roasted chicken. Perfectly cooked nice and moist with tons of flavour and the risotto was cooked perfectly. My sister and I shared the cheesecake which was again delicious. Would 100% recommend  :)
Fable,"I have to say, figure out a line-up system!!! It's unfortunate because you end up turning away good patrons. Though your food is good, the service can often severely be lacking."
Fable,"One of the all-around best restaurants in Kitsilano, Fable has served as an awesome treat for my girlfriend and I for over 2 years now. We don't go often, but whenever we do we're always blown away. The quality food and drink, comforting atmosphere and knowledgable staff make this place one of my favorites for a relaxing evening out on the town."
Fable,"I'm on the fence about this one. My mom took me here on my birthday and the place was bustling but it only took us a minute to get a table. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share and it was all incredible, i especially enjoy the duck.. But the bad news is that I ordered their special Oyster and it gave me food poisoning so I spent the night of my birthday hurling into the kitchen sink because i couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Even after that nightmare... i'd give it another go. And i'd stay away from the seafood."
Fable,"Fantastic place, and amazing service.  Went on a wed night and the place was packed.  When is full, the noise level does go up.   Went with 6 friends and we could barely hear the other end of the table.  (only reason i'm rating this as 4 and not 5 stars)  The meat balls pasta and the canned tuna were simply awesome.  We ended up ordering 2 more orders of this just to share cause they were so good.  Had the halibut as the main, and it was also very good.  Lemon pot de cream for desert, light and refreshing.

Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
Fable,Simply the best food and the best service in Vancouver.  The chickpea fritters are not to be missed!
Fable,Couldn't put a finger on anything. Specials were great and the service was fantastic.
Fable,"Yum! This place is fantastic. So much variety here, there's something for everybody. My friend has a number of allergies and food intolerances, and they were able to accommodate her no problem. It's definitely on the pricey side, but the quality of the food justifies it, and the service is great to boot."
Fable,"We returned to Fable after a year away and loved it still!  I want to give it five stars because all but one of our dishes were beautiful and tasty, all components wonderfully cooked and balanced, worth the time and effort that clearly were put into their planning and execution.  This is a warm restaurant, the staff is thrilled with the dishes, knowledgeable about the wine and striving to make your experience a special one.  

We had the cheddar cornbread and chipotle butter -  very nice start!  Our first course was shared and seasonal - pulled pork fritters with a bit of spring onion and what seemed like dill tartar sauce.  We enjoyed these very much.  The main dish was goose two ways with cranberry jelly and vegetables, and the squash gnocchi with pulled pork.  The goose was nicely done and a good dish (the sliced goose on top was a little too chewy to be perfect), but the gnocchi were fantastic! This dish had a sage pesto sauce phenomenally fragrant and rich, some vegetables and apple gastrique.  It was so aromatic I literally gave the dinner five stars for this dish and the dessert alone.  Without this dish, as good as the experience was it would have been 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  Dessert was a deconstructed marscapone cheesecake with chai caramel sauce, apple butter and brittle.  WOW.  This was the perfect meal for a memorable evening.  Well worth it! 

Our wine selection was also highly recommended a nice medium bodied spanish Rioja with no bite, went well with everything and opened up as the evening went on.  Love Fable, the atmosphere, the lighting, the collaborative atmosphere between chefs, wine/bar and service.  Terrific!"
Fable,"We really enjoyed our meal here, great atmosphere and nice eclectic menu. One of the favorites of this place was supposed to be the canned tuna, sadly that was the only thing my wife and I didnt like, but our other friend loved it. We had a great heirloom tomato salad and chickpea fritters. My wife had the Spaghetti and Meatballs for dinner, which was great. I had the pork special which was perfect and came with kale. Our friend had the Gnocchi which was probaly the best of all and which you can add pork belly too, that would be my first suggestion. Ended the night with Marscapone Cheescake, which was fantastic. This restaurant, the chefs and the staff would fit very well into the LA restaurant scene."
Fable,My husband and I went there for brunch. I had the breakfast biscuit and he had the steak and eggs. ( both were amazing) We sat at the counter ( with all the action) and I have to say that it was one of the best and unique brunch experiences I've ever had!
Fable,"Impressive service - warm, friendly, efficient!   Ordered chickpea fritters that were absolutely delicious...so much flavour and served warm. P Gnocchi -delicious!!  Not too heavy and packed with flavour and texture with nuts, pesto, peas....fantastic!   Will definitely try brunch at Fable next.  And did I mention the service was outstanding?!"
Fable,Terrific gourmet experience. All dishes were complex and delicious creations. The staff was delightful giving a warm welcome and friendly service. Can't wait to return.
Fable,"I had their prix fixe menu, which is only available by advanced request.  The food was incredible as was the value.    For only $48-person, we got 6 courses (plus a little extra).  The food here is some of the best that can be found in Vancouver.  I highly recommend Fable!"
Fable,Great food. Very friendly staff and very nice and cozy environment. The price is not that expensive but it would be for a special occasion for sure.
Fable,By far our absolute favorite place to dine in town. Perfect in every way (except for their tea brand)
Fable,"I was a big fan of Fuel and Refuel, but I'm happy to say that Fable delights as well. The menu is unpretentious (3 main lunch options rather than 14 pages): simple and sophisticated. Our server was dynamite (girl with the curly blonde hair). We've been there twice and will head back soon."
Fable,"Cannot speak highly enough about the amazing food at Fable.  We shared the chick pea fritters and the duck meatball - both were phenomenal, really!  My husband had the potato-crusted chicken (how did they DO that???) and I had the lightest gnocchi this side of a Cena in Portland - I'm surprised it didn't float - with sweet peas and pea shoots.  The flavour was perfection, I can't imagine how it could be improved upon.  And for heaven sake, don't skip the ""sweet bite"" dessert!  We got it to go and I misunderstood the server, thinking it was either a macaron or a pavlova or a marshmallow.  There were 2 of each - the bargain of the century for $10!  Staff were friendly and professional, food was absolutely stellar.  Can't WAIT to go back!"
Fable,"Let me start by saying that I love Fable's style. I walked in and was very impressed with the brick walls and dim lights. They pull off the dim lighting very well, without making it overly romantic or stuffy so it's a good place to go for most occasions. I did feel as though my usual loud, joking antics were out of place there and subdued myself slightly. The food was fantastic. The chicken was mind blowing - best I've ever had. It was also gone in three bites, and that isn't a testament to how great it tasted, it's a testament to the fact that I got a minuscule portion for way more than I thought  was a fair price. As a relatively small guy, I rarely run into portions that I find are too small, and have never met them at small restaurants on 4th that live in the same neighbourhood as The Noodle Box and Scoop. I was wearing a t shirt and shorts, so I was pretty sure I hadn't stumbled into a five star restaurant with a two month long waiting list and taken Bruce Waynes reservation by mistake, so why were the portions so tiny and the bill so pricey? I'm no foody by any means, so the ""best chicken I've ever had"" isn't worth the preposterous price for me. I'll stick to the ""damn good chicken"" I can get elsewhere in larger portions at lower prices. The service did make up for the experience, as they noticed my displeasure and compensated for it adequately. I can definitely see Fable as being right up someone's alley, but not my alley. The decor and ambience are impressive and the cooking is great, but I think they should reevaluate their prices and portion sizes and be truer to their location."
Fable,"Really delicious food and a great, comfortable well-designed atmosphere. One star off for the limited non-alcoholic beverage selection and the gruesome chicken bone that was in my otherwise delicious pulled chicken sandwich. But don't let that stop you - this place is great."
Fable,Best piece of duck EVER!  Unbelievebly tender!  There were a couple of glitches during the meal but they were prompty addresses and corrected.  I will definitely go back...and I'll have the duck again...and again....and again......
Fable,I love the food here.  The service is always great.  Thanks again Fable
Fable,"Came here for brunch and it was really delish! It was cool meeting Trevor and Curtis in person. I have no complaints about the food, except that portion size could be slightly bigger =P"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"part 2 of the staycation with the mother. was hoping that the lineup for jam wouldn't be AS long since it's the pandemic and all...and well there was still a line! mom and i waited abt 30min for a table but it wasn't too bad of a wait - i've heard that the waits were longer before covid.

jam did not reduce the number of tables inside the restaurant but there were plexiglass boards btwn the tables so you are safe. hand sanitizer ofc and one-time menus were provided. i was a little lost with the choices but luckily, there's yelp! 

mom and i ordered coffee and tea to start for drinks - service was great here as they kept coming back thruout our time at the restaurant to check if we needed more coffee/hot water. mom def had her cup refilled several times. i did get hot water added to my teapot once :) our serve also asked if we needed condiments (ketchup, hot sauce etc.) when we ordered so that was given to us before our food arrived.

mom had the blackstone benny - the poached egg rolled off of one of the bennies and the server asked (sweetly!) whether we wanted to send it back so the egg can be fixed. my mom and i thought it was fine but it was very nice of them to do so. mom loved the bacon! she also was devouring the hashbrown again - she loves her potatoes lol 

i ordered the charlie bowl - good thing i came hungry because the portion is def enough for 2ppl. i was able to eat it all but by the end of the bowl, i was stuffed. all the flavours in the bowl turned into the mouthful of yums - the biscuit, the bacon, the ham, the hashbrown and the gravy. the sunny side egg with the runny yolk adds another layer of goodness. 

mom and i each had a bit of each other's dish and again, no complaints there. even with the busy hub bub of the restaurant, no one rushed us to leave - they nicely gave us the bill when they saw that we were both done and ofc, we knew that it was their subtle msg for us to wrap it up but it wasn't like they were constantly onto us abt it. 

i can ttly see why there's a line for this place!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The absolute best brunch in Vancouver!! And I do not say this lightly!! Since covid-19 happened, every weekend all I can think about is a nice passion fruit mimosa and Charlie bowl at Jam. I spent years trying all the hyped Vancouver brunch spots, and let me tell you - this is it!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Love the atmosphere and the servers energy. Everyones always so friendly. If you've ever been to jam cafe you would know theres always a line up (even with covid lol) but it is always worth it! Recommendations- charlie bowl and the sugar cured bacon. -chefs kiss-
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One word. Showstopping. This cutie little spot on Beatty street is filled with lovely people and cool decor. I myself ordered the chicken French toast honestly for 18 dollars that was AWESOME!!!! Jalapeño sour cream, pickled cabbage and a sweet bbq sauce. My tastebuds have never been so HAPPY. Steph ordered fried chicken benny which also slapped. Honestly when you guys go pls order fried chicken.So juicy and boneless the best combo. It a busy and no reservations so... good luck.
Im out yelpers.
-Emma"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try this popular brunch place out! My friend and I arrived on Sunday around 11 am and there was a line still, but nowhere as long as I've seen it before in the past.

You get in line, and eventually someone who works for the restaurant will come down the line and take your name and party size. We were seated after a 30 minute wait, which isn't too bad. They said it was faster for parties of 2, and I noticed they skipped larger parties of 3-4 people a couple times in front of me to seat parties of 2.

They don't seat you unless your whole party is there.

The inside of the restaurant is smaller, which means that tables are not spaced six feet apart. However, they have clear plastic screens between all tables which are wiped down after each party, so I felt perfectly safe dining here.

I love a good fried chicken biscuit with gravy, so as soon as I saw The Gravy Coops ($19) on the menu, I knew exactly what I was getting. No hesitation! I was pretty excited, as it's an uncommon brunch dish to find in these parts.

It's definitely a heavier dish. I was pretty hungry when I got here and was only able to finish about half. The biscuits are the biggest I've ever seen in my life, and they don't skimp on the chicken either. Between the biscuit, fried chicken, eggs, and sausage gravy, each bite was incredibly satisfying.

I wasn't as impressed with the hash browns, which were a little too buttery for my taste and not crispy enough.

My vegetarian friend got the smashed avocado benedict and enjoyed his dish as well."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When I first saw the food photos of Jam Café I wasn't that surprised. It didn't look that good? HOWEVER...the food tastes 300x better than it looks. I hope someone else out there has experienced this dissonance, sometimes I lie awake in bed thinking about it.

I got the smoked salmon benny and everything was cooked to perfection. The hashbrowns were fragrant and salty (I hate when hashbrowns aren't salted enough).  and the texture of the benny was so nice. Thinkin bout that english muffin to this day...

I can't wait to try more dishes from this place, I'm sure it will be delish. The long wait to get in is not so delish though...."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Overhyped brunch location - though a good spot to stop by if you catch a time when they're line is not too long! I personally would not wait over 15 minutes in line just to eat here, but you often find this establishment PACKED. The food is good at its price point, but I wouldn't say that it stands out far amongst comparable restaurants.

[Items Tried]

The Later Tater Bowl (5/5) - $18
Taste: An amazing bowl that mixes various textures of soft and tender pulled pork,  crispy tater tots, melted cheese, egg, and onion. I think what makes this taste so good is the crunchy, yet soft textures the blend so well together - top this off with their in-house hot sauce and voila! Perfection. Only thing that may have been nice was if the eggs were a tad runnier.
Portion Size: Good for two to share.

Chicken French Toast (3/5) - $18
Taste: This dish was just OK - a tad on the drier side for the chicken and I wish the french toast was more fluffy, definitely too dense for my liking. The pickled cabbage was a nice touch, the sauces were just ok.
Portion Size: Good size for two people to share - chicken to toast ratio was good; however, the toast was really dense and as a result hard to finish.

[Value for Money]
Jam Café prices their dishes fairly; I think the biggest consideration here is whether you want to wait 20 min. upwards to grab brunch in downtown or not!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great service & yummy eats!
Arriving at 11 on a Wednesday we got a table for 2 no problem. The service was great, they were all very attentive and lovely.
I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict on special which was delicious and my cousin got the veggie bowl which he enjoyed too.
My coffee was topped up frequently and not one but 2 servers quality checked on us.
I can see why this place is so popular!!
By the time we left around 12:15 there was a long line already and they don't take reservations so I recommend coming early. But it'd be worth the wait in my opinion if you cannot go early ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We had a lovely brunch here. The line was short and calm on a beautiful Sunday morning. We were seated almost by the window - with plexiglass dividers. The roasted tomato on the black stone Benny was perfect with the most absolutely flavourful and well-executed hollandaise. The banana walnut pancakes were too big to finish. The menu is currently condensed, but the offerings were just enough. Service was quick and super friendly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We stopped by here for our first breakfast in Vancouver and we absolutely loved it! We waited about 8 minutes in the 40 degree weather, and coming from Hawaii where the normal temperature is like 77, you could bet your horses that I was freeeeeezing my butt off in that line. But it was all worth it once we stepped into the warm, cozy restaurant. They even had a blanket on the chair to warm us up! 

Service was fine - the girl helping us outside in the queue was super nice and gave us her recommendations. Our server seemed a little nervous but he did a nice job taking our order and constantly refilling our waters too. 

My boyfriend got the Charlie Bowl and it was so good, and SO filling. It's a mishmash of all the best breakfast foods into one bowl! Biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, cheese, corn, and an egg! 

I got the Chicken & Waffles, which was also very good! The waffles were a little on the dry side with not much flavor, so I ended up leaving the last 1/4, but the chicken and gravy were delicious! The chicken was super crispy on the outside and crazy juicy and tender on the inside, and seasoned perfectly. 

The portions here are MUCH bigger than I thought it would be. If i'm ever back in Vancouver, I'll definitely make it a point to stop here again - this time I'm getting the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes because literally everyone around us was getting it and it looked so. freakin. good."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brunch on steroids. There's no other way to describe my experience here all the way from the 1hr line up to the crash I experienced after gobbling down those cinnamon bun pancakes. It was a whirlwind of an experience and I'm a bit miffed to say that there's a growing hunger in my belly right at this moment as I think back to those times.

I tried to try as many options as I could. The portion sizes are nuts, which is good because I had quite an appetite to nurture after the wait. One of the nice things to note is that they're pretty good at accommodating dietary restrictions. The Gravy Coop was phenomenal, but many of their savoury options stem from a variation of a single dish. There is plenty of fried chicken to be eaten. However, there are other dishes that are quite different. It's nice to see that they have SO SO SO many options. One thing that I won't leave up to choice is the pancakes - specifically the cinnamon bun pancakes. GET THEM! I'm a savoury girl, so my jonesing for these pancakes is quite alarming..

Bottomless coffee is a perk so grab a cup and their other drinks are pretty cute. Service is quick which makes sense considering the line up. They are fast, efficient, and super kind. Thank you, Jam, for an unforgettable experience!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There is usually a line outside of this restaurant for a reason.. the food, drinks and service are worth the wait. I ordered the Gravy Coop with fried chicken and bottomless coffee: the perfect comfort food combo for a lazy Sunday brunch. The prices are pretty standard for Vancouver brunch, the location is cozy and great spot to bring friends. Am a huge brunch guy and I Will be back! Highly recommend the Gravy Coop and fried chicken Benny"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Over priced, long wait times for terrible service only to be rushed out so they can set up the next table. Stop giving this place so much hype when you have to wait over half hour for food only to get 15 minutes to eat before you get rushed out."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you're making a trip to Vancouver, put Jam on your itinerary. So sad I didn't have enough time to eat the entire menu but delicious enough to make me come back twice to try out other menu items. Like all the places I've been to, the staff is fantastic and friendly.

The food is delicious. The coconut banana waffle special was so yummy and crunchy. Both flavors balanced each other out and didn't overpower one another. The biscuit and gravy was also tasty. The pancake was fluffy and just right. The maple syrup is better in Canada. I thought it might be too sweet or bland so I would have to overload it but I was wrong. The flavor was tasty and not so sticky and thick. Ooo, I want to come back for more.

The second trip included corned beef and three piglets. We had no idea the three piglets was a corndog wrapped in a pancake. It says it in the menu but I thought they were deep fried small breakfast sausages like back home. It was a wonderful surprise. With the maple syrup, the taste and texture was just right. The corned beef had so much to it like hash browns and veggies.

Jam knows how to do breakfast right. I was lucky I stayed two blocks away but get there early. There's already a line forming by 8. But so worth it :p"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've read so many reviews about this place and it was definitely worth the hype and the line! I came here on a Friday and it was packed, but I was seated promptly after a 20 minute wait. The staff is very friendly, greeting you before you enter. I waited before it opened and they were outside 5 minutes beforehand greeting people and asking for party size.

The first time I got the biscuits and gravy option with fried chicken, Monty pancake, and banana coconut waffle off the special menu. All of it was so good! The chicken wasn't dry, perfectly crispy and moist. The biscuit was flaky and amazing. Our server noticed how much we were offering and suggested that we only get 1 pancaKe because it's huge, very glad that's an option. I have to say that the sweeter breakfast choices were not too sweet!

The 2nd time I came here, we got the corned beef hash and the three pig that look like corn dogs but it's better. It's a wrapped in pancake batter and the sausage is a breakfast one not a hot dog one. More savory this time, but still amazing. They do breakfast so well here! I can't wait to come back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I walked by today & was happy to see that there was no lineup down the street for once! Without hesitation and any preconceived ideas, I walked in to (FINALLY!) try this place (cause I don't do long wait line-ups for food)

It was noon, but I felt like ""breakfast"" - settled on some The Fully Monty Pancakes & sugar-cured bacon. The bacon is definitely worth trying - thicker than what I was expecting & not too sweet. The maple butter that comes with the pancakes is ah-mazing & the pancakes were huge & fluffy! There was enough for leftovers to take home (wished that I could've had the remaining maple butter too!)

I also ordered a The Herald Omelette to go for my guy, as I felt guilty coming here without him. It looks delicious!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's been years since I came here for brunch; I honestly only remembered Jam Cafe as THAT place that always had seemingly never ending line ups. Anyways, my friend was back in town and she was craving. So what did we do? Get up at the crack of dawn and trek to downtown of course! We both arrived at around 7:40am (real early for me on a weekend) and we were third in line. 

We were welcomed by very cheerful staff who seated us right away at 8am. The space was a bit tight though; we were almost glued to another table.

My friend got the Cinnamon Bun pancakes and I got the Chicken French Toast (and bottomless coffee cuz I needed it). Oh my, the food was enormous. There was a mountain of bread and chicken the size of my face! Even the pancakes were essentially the size of plates - very generous portions I must say. 
The chicken French toast was different from how I imagined. The food was sort of drowned in syrup, creating a pool around the toast. It was topped off with pickled cabbage which added a nice acidity to the sweetness. It was good, but I think personally, I would have liked something with more conventional flavours. 
The pancakes, on the other hand, were memorably delicious - fluffy, flavourful and huge. The flavours were sort of reminiscent to cinnamon bun pop tarts but in a much fluffier format.

It was a definitely fun time trying to beat the line, and the food was delicious, but I definitely wouldn't do this all the time. I am curious to try their other options though - so maybe some other time..."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I got here around 2PM on a Saturday and waited about 30 minutes for a party of two. There was no waitlist so you have to line up outside of the restaurant. Make sure you're dress appropriately for the weather because it is a long wait. The inside was a bit small and cramped, but nicely decorated. 

My boyfriend and I shared The Charlie and chicken fried toast. I love breakfast and was looking forward to trying this place. However, the food was just mediocre. The first few bites were good, but then it just felt underwhelming. I did enjoy the Jam iced coffee though and service was good overall."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came in to have brunch while visiting Vancouver. Service was friendly and the dining atmosphere was relaxed and casual. I loved the dining room decor, it was a bit kitschy, but I really liked it. 

Overall the food was very good. To drink, I ordered a London Fog, which was a little sweeter than I expected, but still tasty. Then I  tried a bite of their cinnamon bun pancakes. They were light and fluffy, but not overly sweet, which I liked. As for my main brunch item, I ordered The Later Tater Bowl (with over medium eggs instead of sunny side up). The dish was flavorful, but a little too aggressively seasoned. By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl the sauce was too overpowering and salty. 

If you ever decide to come on a weekend for brunch like we did, then get ready to wait a while. Although portion sizes were generous, I did find their prices to be a bit overpriced."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Get here early or be prepared to wait! They open at 8am and I arrived a little after that and it was already packed and when I was leaving there was a line outside.

Pros:
-Super friendly staff and very attentive!
-Tasty food, large portions.

Cons:
-Nothing really that bad... best of luck getting a seat!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is one of those restaurants that has been on my bucket list for years, though have always been turned off by the gargantuan line that extends from their front door and goes down around the block into Gastown. However, I was eventually convinced by some colleagues that it would make a great brunch joint to hit up. After an hour or so of waiting, we were seated and boy, it was hard to choose just one item from the menu. At the recommendation of a colleague, I ordered the Charlie Bowl (17.00). It consisted of crispy biscuits and hash browns at the bottom topped with some cubed ham, bacon, delicious fried egg, melted gooey cheese, and their oh so amazing meaty sausage gravy. Once you puncture the egg yolk, the yolk and the sausage gravy will make each bite of the crispy biscuits and hash browns below godly. The bowl didn't look too big but holy this thing is SO HEAVY! 

Worth the wait? Mm.. maybe 20-30 minutes, but wouldn't wait an hour again. Quality was pretty good, but the price is pretty up there for breakfast. Service was very attentive though!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Possibly one of the best brunch meals I've ever had but with the cost of waiting 2 hours in line outside! The restaurant does provide umbrellas if it's raining.  If you have a smaller group you may luck out and be able to skip some groups in line. 

I ordered the Later Tater Bowl and lavender lemonade. The drink was sooo good! It had a strong lavender taste which I love. The bowl had lots of complex flavours but they mixed really well together. The portions here are quite large FYI. All of my friends loved their meal! I don't think there's anything you can go wrong with here."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I ordered the Apple Cinnamon French Toast. It was the best french toast I have ever had.

I did not need the maple syrup on the table, the dish was perfect on its own. It was covered in sauce and fresh apples that were absolutely delicious! The bread was nicely thick as french toast should be.

On top of the french toast was a gooseberry (I believe it was a gooseberry). In the pictures, that is the little leaf. I had it at the end. I had never had one before and it was sour but very, very tasty and good!

I also ordered an Almond Milk Latte that was delicious. I usually drink soy milk, but almond milk is okay, too, and this almond milk was very good. I thoroughly enjoyed my latte.

I would go back in a heartbeat. I wish I were closer! I know I will be visiting this restaurant again and again and again...

Accessibility: We went to the Vancouver Beatty St location. It was not accessible. The front door had a step up. The restaurant was crowded, tight, and very busy. We did go on a Sunday morning, which likely contributed to this. From what I know, it is generally always busy with a line queuing on the street. The noise level was loud, but I could still hear everyone at the table. It could be an issue for some people. The lighting should not be an issue. The washrooms are large though I do not know about grab bars. The chairs do NOT have arms. All tables are low tables. On the walls are booth bench seating and the front windows are booths. The windows can make that seating colder."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Their portions are huge!!!! Definitely split a meal if you have a small stomach. Every time I've gone here I wasn't able to finish 2/3 of my dish. Which is disappointing because usually they don't store well. 

I've had their french toast with chicken. It came to about $18. It wasn't regular eggy french toast with maple syrup and powdered sugar. It had a savoury syrup on the bottom of the plate. I think it was the same sauce for the chicken as well. The piece of chicken was pretty good. The appeal of this place is the huge plate sizes they serve, basically. 

Also, I would recommend staying away from getting fruit as a side because the fruits don't go together. I had grapes, watermelon, strawberries, and grapefruit in mine."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"To all the brunch peeps out there: Jam Cafe is the place to be! 
My boyfriend and I did a weekend getaway in Vancouver. Found this spot on Yelp (4.5 stars with 900+ reviews what!) so we had to check it out. 

As we approached the restaurant, there was already a line outside. We waited around 30 minutes. The restaurant itself is pretty small. We were seated at the bar. 

What we ordered:
Charlie Bowl - YUM! I was worried it was going to be salty but it was delicious. Don't be fooled by the pics you see, the portion is huge. Super filling for 2 people. 
Fried Chicken Jam Benny - Fried chicken was nicely crispy and not dry at all, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Came with hash browns too, which were also great. 
We were so full by the end and even better, it's definitely a bang for your buck! 

Service was superb. Our server was so considerate and attentive as we dined, making sure she knew any allergies and whatever else we needed beforehand. 

5/5 for this whole experience! This place really does live up to its hype."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Before I even talk about the food, I have to commend the service here! 10/10 - the servers are so on top of things it's rare to see a popular brunch spot run so efficiently. Right down the the check split, I am so so impressed! 

The food is solid but not worth waiting an hour for; The jam iced coffee which is essentially viet iced coffee, I would recommend adding a shot of espresso because it is on the sweeter side. I split the fried chicken benny with my bf and then shared the raspberry lemon pancakes with the table. The pancake serving is massive and unless you're a carbivore, it would be a massive feat to tackle by yourself!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The last stop during my VanCity girl's trip... And BOY did Jam Cafe deliver! 

We went here per recommendation of Isabelle, the Yelp Vancouver CM. I was a little apprehensive because the line was SO long. We literally waited about an hour outside to get in. It was insane! However, I'm glad we stuck it out.

For starters, service was great. Very nice people - but that's just Canada, eh?

I had a tough time figuring out what to order... from the Corned Beef Skillet to the Banana Pancakes, EVERYTHING sounded good. But, I ended up going with a Classic Eggs Benny. Ha! 

The Benny was delicious. Hollandaise was amazing and the eggs were cooked perfectly. It was, dare I say, a perfect dish all around! 

To pair, I got a Creamsicle Mimosa. And yes, it's as fantastic as it sounds. I think it's probably my most favorite mimosa I've ever had! It even comes with a cream/foam on top to stay true to a creamsicle. So. Good.

Hands down, don't even THINK TWICE about going. Just. Go. Even if it's a two hour wait. Go!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Coming highly rated, Jam Cade was no let down. We slid in an hour before close at 2pm and were able to snag a readily available table for 2. Our server, Diana, was pleasant and adorable. 

Now down to the nitty gritty...the RASPBERRY LEMON PANCAKES (5/5)??!!!!???? Oh those heavenly pillowy tangy culinary miracles!!!! The lemon curd and raspberry coulis made the decadent pancakes bright and delicious bite after bite. I was proud to demolish half of the 3 huge hot cakes while starving. No better way to break fast. My mom enjoyed the JAM FRITTATA (4/5)...ok...maybe I helped her lol. But all of the food was perfection! 

I will admit the cocktails left a bit more to be desired. Both the MIMOSA and the GRAPEFRUIT GIMME (3/5) were just meh. I ordered a double for the gimme and still couldn't find the gin. Good thing I love grapefruit! Lol"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I love pork belly here and the coffee with a little bit milk and suger. This good place for brunch and chatting with friend. I will come back restaurant.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I knew I had to come here because of the huge line the first time I came by and the rave reviews on Yelp.

We arrived about 40 min after opening and had about 8 people in front of us. Took about 15-20 to get in which isn't bad since the line length quadrupled shortly after we arrived. The inside is packed with little space between tables which is understandable.

We ordered a cold brew and a dirty drunk chai which I recommend if you're looking for a little pick me up with your coffee. Cold brew was pretty standard but not too sweet which was great. 

Food wise, there was so many good options that it took a while to choose. We decided on The Later Tater Bowl with Chipotle Chicken and the Pulled Pork Pancakes. The Later Tater Bowl is some amazing comfort food and the portion is huge. Tater tots, chicken, cheese, eggs, salsa, and corn is a great combo and I couldn't even finish it (surprising for me). My girlfriend's pulled pork pancakes were great as well and big even for a half portion. It was sweet and savory. Didn't even need the syrup they provided. 

I understand the hype even more now and it's a definite must go to anyone visiting or needing a hearty breakfast."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Nom nom, we had a wonderful breakfast here one rainy morning.  My generous sister-in-law took our hotel car service to go wait in line for us, and we showed up 45 minutes later with the kids and got seated shortly after.  I had a very delicious biscuit with scrambled eggs, my son's Mac and cheese looked very creamy, and my husband liked his Bloody Mary.  

The decor is quaint and cute, bathrooms are clean, and the food is delicious!  It's within walking distance to Gastown if you need to walk off the calories afterwards!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We had arrived at 7:53 AM on a weekday and was shocked to see a long line. Luckily we barely made it to the end of first seating, but a number of people were stuck waiting outside.

After eating a couple of bites, I could see why this place is popular. Breakfast here is delicious and also very filling!

-----
The Gravy Coop: buttermilk biscuit topped with fried chicken or pork belly, two sunny eggs, green onions, sausage or mushroom gravy. Served with hash browns ($18).

I picked the fried chicken with sausage gravy, and it was delightful! More gravy to accompany the large biscuit would have been nice.
-----
The Herald Street Omelette: with two fillings. Served with hash browns and toast ($16).

Menu lists a good selection of fillings to choose from. Omelette was cooked well and a decent size for its price.
-----"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Gave Jam Cafe a second chance.... Had the vegetarian bennys with tater tots this time- much much better than the frittata. Boyfriend had the veggie bowl- it was alright but the bennys were by far the star of our meal! 

Great coffee and mimosas. Overall would return for the bennys and definitely substitute the hashbrown for the tatertots if you are a fan of cripsy potatoes!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As fate would have it, my fiancé and I stayed down the street from Jam Cafe in our Airbnb. Like we could literally roll out of bed and stand in line within 5 minutes. On our first morning there, the line was way too long for comfort, so we waited 'til the next day. Still a 20-30 minute wait, which I wouldn't do again, but I'm glad I tried this place once.

I was a little too ambitious with ordering food, which is typical for me. Got the Later Tater Bowl ($16) which had fried tater tots, pulled pork, corn salsa, green onions, cheddar cheese, sausage gravy, chimichurri, and two sunny side eggs. Holy crap. I also got a side of fried pork belly and a Bloody Mary. 

Definitely couldn't finish everything and saved the rest for later. I don't remember what my fiancé got, but I liked my food. Pork belly and Bloody Mary were the best parts... oh and the toast and jam. It was a quick meal. The cafe was crowded, and I felt like we were being rushed, but that line is insane. Worth it if you have a few hours to spare!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came here on a Tuesday around noon, wow the line already built outside the cafe. We waited for around 30 mins to get seated.
We tried London fog, which is earl grey tea with milk. It's alright but next time I will try something else.
Chicken and waffle is always my favorite dish, I saw they have chicken with French toast, I love their bbq sauce and pickled veggies on side, but I personally prefer the waffle better as they have a crispy texture. 
Egg Benedict with smashed avocado is very good combination but be aware if you are not  a fan of goat cheese, make sure you mention it when you ordered.
The Charlie bowl is quite popular on here as I see many people posting the picture, but it's not my favorite. It's too heavy for us."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Their line was waaaay out the door so we opted for carryout instead. 

After reading reviews, we saw how much of a hit their fried chicken was so we got the later tater tot and subbed in fried chicken instead of the pulled pork. It was delicious and I wish we could've had it fresh in the restaurant. 

Definitely worth a visit if you're in Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Got lucky and there was no wait. We tried going the day before, but the line was 1hr+. Seems to be a theme in vancouver with the good brunch spots.

We ordered a couple of dishes. The portions are huge so I recommend sharing plates (which we should've done).

Biscuit fried chicken - skip the mushroom gravy... it does not taste good! do the sausage gravy. The rest of this dish is great, the fried chicken has a really nice crunch and is well cooked. 

later tater bowl w/ chicken - This was a pretty good dish, I'm not a huge fan of tator tots so I couldnt imagine having a whole dish of this... but I took a couple of bites and it was pretty good. 

The service was pretty good and on top of things. There wasnt a huge line the entire time we were inside so I cant speak to what it's like when they have those crazy busy times."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"They don't take reservations, so unless you're ready in line at like 7:30 am get ready to wait 1 hour+!

We had a party of 4 and waited 1 hour 20 min for a table, and by the time we got our door it was almost 2 hours in.

It's tiny tiny inside! That's why the wait is so bad.

FOOD--
Chorizo Benedict - they don't actually have this on the menu anymore lol but I subbed the bacon for chorizo instead and also added avocado. I'm not really the biggest Benedict fan but after seeing them serve bennys to neighbors I wanted one real bad! The benny itself was sooo delicious. It comes with hash browns which I thought were just okay

Sausages dipped in pancake batter - really rich! Comes with 3. Good to share with a table, I think a whole dish to myself would be too much. 

Brûlée'd grapefruit - soo interesting! I think you should def try one. Sugar is scorched on top of the grape fruit like a regular Crème brûlée is.

Strawberry banana French toast - good but average. Toast is really thick and filling. 

All the dishes come with a TON of food!

SERVICE--
Like I said, this place is BUSYYY!!! expect long wait for food after you order. 

AMBIANCE--
Brunchy, casual, tiny, cramped, only good for small group

I'd be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I think we waited in line for breakfast for a solid hour and it was only a Monday so I can't imagine what it's like on the weekend. Regardless It was 110% worth it. Our waitress was great, our food and drinks came out in no time, and it was some of the best tasting food I've had in a long time. 

My classic eggs Benedict was to die for. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise was rich and creamy yet somehow still light, the English muffin was fluffy and tasted like it was homemade, and I ate the home fries without and ketchup (because they didn't have any, must be a Canada thing?) and I didn't even mind because they have great texture and flavor. I decided to splurge and get a banana walnut pancake on the side as well and I'm so happy I did. I might have felt like I was going to barf after stuffing my face so much but it was well worth it. The pancake was fluffy and moist, bananas were cooked and caramelized perfectly, simply delicious. I know everyone else at the table who got Benedict's said they were amazing too. 

We also had alcoholic drinks which really hit the spot after waiting an hr. I had baileys iced coffee and a dirty chia, both were strong and super tasty. My boyfriend had the Bloody Mary (or bloody Caesar as they call it here) and he said it was great! 

If you ever are in Vancouver and have the opportunity to go to this joint I highly recommend you suck it up and wait in line, you will not be disappointed!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"First brunch and overall restaurant while visiting Vancouver. Came here around 145 and there was still a line. 
Wait time was about 30 mins. 
Definitely recommend. The server was very friendly and had a great conversation. 

I will definitely return if I'm ever in the area."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow great Caesar Mary just the right amount of spice a( the breakfasts as just ok did not care for the hash browns. Super busy place with antique attractions on the walls. You better get here early since the line goes down the block. Limited seating. Nice people and great customer service. 
The menu has many options and they ask about allergies before you order. 
Fun place with ok food."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Whenever I ask anyone which brunch and breakfast place they'd recommend, it's always Jam Cafe. And it's not just the recommendations, but you can tell from the consistent lineups everyday that this place is something special. It took me a long time to try Jam Cafe out because usually I don't want to wait in line for a long time, but I finally got the chance to try it and understand what the hype is all about. Waiting in line wasn't that long when I went on a weekday. Waited about ~40 minutes or so. As soon as we got inside and received our food, it compensated entirely the time that we spent waiting. It's ridiculously good. Best brunch and breakfast I've had in a long time. Dishes are pricey but they're huge!! You definitely get what you pay for. Server is attentive too, because you kind of have to be in such a busy cafe. Overall, I loved the experience and definitely would come back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good things come to those who wait. This is certainly true at Vancouver's Jam Cafe, where the line forms before they open. On the weekends, waits can stretch as long as two hours at this popular local restaurant. With this knowledge in hand, we planned our well-timed visit on a Monday morning around 9am and escaped with only a 20 minute wait.

They've certainly squeezed as many tables as they could inside their dining rooms, which are decorated with various country knick knacks. Their vast seasonal menu spans both breakfast and lunch - nothing fancy, just good old-fashioned comfort food.

My husband's Harrison Salmon Scramble, a heaping pile of eggs scrambled with onion cream cheese, topped with a few slices of smoked salmon, came on a hearty multigrain toast. Usually salmon dishes tend to skimp on the fish, but this one certainly did not. At $15.50 ($11.70 USD), the scramble was generously portioned, served with a side of mixed greens, with chickpeas in a vinaigrette.

My teenage daughter sulked when I told her to only order a single double chocolate pancake ($9), instead of the triple stack ($14.50). Although I hate to pass up on a good deal, she could not even eat the entire chocolate-laden pancake, leaving 1/3 on her plate (which I eagerly ate). Turns out, mother knows best.

After much deliberation, I finally decided on the Dutch baby with apples and cinnamon ($12). It arrived in a hot cast iron skillet, a beautifully puffy ring with the fruit in the middle. I liked that it was not too sweet and didn't send me into a sugar coma (though that double chocolate pancake managed to do the trick).

Even though the food has that homespun charm, Jam Cafe takes extra care in the presentation, with each dish photo-ready.  Service was friendly and efficient, too. We emerged, bellies happy and full.  If you're willing to wait, Jam Cafe's definitely the place for generous portions of food made with love."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've now been to Jam Cafe on multiple occasions and have to recommend it to people who love breakfast foods. Their eggs benny are amazing, always perfectly cooked with a delicious hollandaise sauce. (Sometimes I wish the accompaniments of the bennys were a bit better, they tend to look small by themselves on the plate because they're only served with a hash brown). 

I've had the Charlie Bowl on multiple occasions and highly recommend sharing/splitting it with one or two people. (What I learned worked fantastically was to get one Charlie Bowl and one full order of cinnamon pancakes to split between three people). I personally like subbing the gravy for mushroom gravy, it gives my arteries a bit of relief.

Their fried chicken is yummy, their waffles are yummy, they poach a mean egg. All in all, if health is not your biggest priority, you should give this place a try !"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"THE BEST BRUNCH PLACE EVER
I have always avoided maple syrup because the ones in america are just too sweet and yucky but REAL maple syrup is sooo much better. They even had home made jalapeño sauce that was awesome! The fried chicken and egg on a english muffin was delicious-the perfect combination. My friend ordered the three pigs and the sauce for that is REALLY good, not exactly what is was. There is a wait to get into the restaurant most of the times but i think it is totally worth waiting."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is pretty popular with the locals.  I thought it might be full of tourists like us, but nope.  Everyone seemed to live in the area.  That's the mighty power of eavesdropping right there!

Anyway, we stood in line for about an hour.  And, by ""we,"" I mean my wife and daughter.  I took my other daughter to an Asian Grocery store around the way.  At about 45 mins, by wife tells me to come back now.  Good, because I was starving.  

We quickly order up some Brioche French Toast, Blueberry Lemon Triple-stack pancakes, Huevos Rancheros, and Mac And Cheese.  Because the French Toast was made with Brioche, it just made it so much better.  But, when it's topped with Caramlized Cinnamon Apples, you really can't do much better (well, maybe a little whipped cream might have cut down on the sweetness a little).  The pancakes were really good.  While they have many different toppings to choose from, my daughter went with the Blueberry Lemon.  She devoured it.  Maybe not all 3 pancakes, but most of it (hey come on, she's 10!).  The Huevos Rancheros were ok, but living most of my early life in San Diego, you get spoiled with Mexican food.

This was a great visit.  We all left happy and our stomachs full of deliciousness.  Definitely a restaurant that is worth of the long wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Two visits so far! We waited one hour in the cold this most recent visit but both times oh my word the brunch has been so incredible! The style for serving their dishes is commendable. I feel like I always walk into this place and can see the appreciation for culinary perfection. They make their own jam which is so mouthwatering delicious. During my visits so far I've tried the chicken and French toast, macaroni and cheese, and the Later Tater bowl with the chipotle chicken. 

The macaroni and cheese side was a little heavy but good. Definitely not a kraft macaroni and cheese although I still enjoy that. But if anyone wants a comparison.

The French toast to this day is memorable for me. It was the perfect blend of maple and bbq sauce and having a sweet and savory balance. I never thought I'd eat a fried chicken with toast for breakfast but wow!! It's so worthwhile!!! The Later tater bowl has a smoky flavor and with an avocado added it was even more epic!! I really enjoy eating tater tots so this dish was a reasonable choice. If someone cannot bear to eat tater tots or many of them I wouldn't recommend this dish because it is very tater-ful. Definitely recommend this place hands down! The best brunch I've had in Vancouver!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Favourite pancake. the other must-have is the side mac and cheese. 
the only way to not have to line-up for an hour is to go on a weekday."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Maybe we just ordered the wrong things but I was extremely underwhelmed by the food here. The space itself is charming (rustic?) and the staff were so nice and friendly, but the food I found disappointing for such a popular brunch place.

I had the Charlie bowl which was 90% biscuits and shredded potatoes (difficult to distinguish between the two) and 10% ham and bacon. The bacon was pretty good, there was just so little of it. There honestly did not seem to be much else to the bowl. It tasted bland. I ate maybe 1/4 of it (portions were huge)? I took the rest home because I didn't want to waste food but I'm going to have to make other things to eat it with cos it's not something I'd want to just dig in with a spoon.

My friend got the later tater bowl which was better. It had the crispiest tater tots I'd ever had! But the pulled pork was just sweet without much depth. We also shared the Dutch baby special of the day, strawberry shortcake (which they neglected to tell us was $14, not $9 as the regular ones are). It was just okay. I'd never had one before and I wouldn't get it again. It was dense and soggy.

I can imagine coming back and trying other things (maybe the French toast?) but it's a real effort to avoid the long lines. We came 10 minutes before they opened on a Sunday and got the last available seats during the first round of seating. Especially after today's experience, it's not something I would wait an hour for."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"OMFG!!! This place lives up to the hype... I am still dreaming of the cinnamon swirl pancakes and talking about them. 

These were the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten, and I make gourmet pancakes weekly. My son (6) told our server that mine are better, hahaha.... But he is wrong. These are amazing!

The flavor profile is over the top delicious with layers of sweet goodness. If I could do it again, I would skip the savory meal and order a different layer of pancake.

Cinnamon swirl is not the flavor I would have chosen. I would have chosen red velvet or blueberry lemon or even chocolate chocolate chip, BUT now I cannot imagine a pancake tasting better than these.

It was worth the wait, and I wish we would have eaten here earlier on our trip, so we could try all the pancake flavors.

Note: The table next to us looked like they ordered savory pancakes with pulled pork and pickled onions on top."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breatfast ever.

Worth waiting 30 minutes to have a table."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I do not have enough words to describe this place! But, to sum it up, it was AMAZINGGGG!! This place is a must go if you are in Vancouver. We arrived around 10am on a Friday and the place was packed already! We waited about 45 minutes, but I am not complaining - it was totally worth it! Please note that if you have a bigger party, the wait might be a little longer. 

Our waitress was really nice. I had asked her, 'what's in the jam iced coffee?' She responded, 'It's really good, you should get it.' -- I was sold!! LOL! I told her I wanted it - I didn't care that she didn't answer my question lolol. You can tell she loved working there, that's always a good sign!

The portions were big! We went for breakfast, but it ended up being a brunch for us. We ordered their version of the bloody mary and it was delicious. I'm actually not a fan of bloody mary's, but this place killed it! We ended up ordering two!

I do recommend trying everything! But, here is a list of what we ordered and my personal recommendations.
-The charlie bowl - LOVED IT! You have to get this!
-The later tator bowl
-Classic tin cup milkshake - chocolate - GET IT!
-Jam iced coffee - Great ice coffee!
-The old town breakfast
-Blassic jam bacon con caesar - SOOOOO GOOD!
-Bourbonator bacon caesar - Get him too!
-Fries (on the side)

I'll be back!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Okay, so I like others have heard so many great things about this restaurant and how there are long lineups to get in. Well, I finally got a chance to go for the first time and it is nothing special. I have been to better places in Vancouver that serve great breakfast and brunch food. 

Had their smoked salmon benny and it was okay; the shredded hash browns tasted like the potatoes was not clean prior to shredding it and had no flavour to it. One positive thing with the Benny is the hollandaise sauce. Also ordered their famous cinnamon bun pancakes and it was dry -- the only thing that helped was adding more syrup, to give it more moisture.

Too much hype and not worth lining up for."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So I have been on the hunt for my favourite brunch place and at last I think I found it with Jam Cafe. 
Apart from the ridiculous 1 hour long wait time to get in(a good indication of the pure genius of their menu).  




This place is actually good for kids. The kids menu is perfect, great variety and portion sizes. They had a booster seat and that is really helpful when you're a party with a toddler.

Best chicken and waffles I've had ever! Fried chicken is so well seasoned and crispy without being greasy. The waffles and fluffy and melt in your mouth and the gravy is the icing on the cake.

Great variety for brunch menu, we were overwhelmed with choice and in my view that's always a good problem to have.

Highly recommend the chicken and waffles, cinnamon bun pancakes and fried chicken eggs Benedict. Taste upon taste upon taste. Generous size portions and very reasonable prices, most average around $20 per plate. 

Will be making this my go to place for brunch going forward."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Biscuit was basic and they only gave me enough gravy for half of it. Gravy was decent but had no edge (something that makes it standout from other's)  I had to scrape it in the egg yolk so there was some kind of flavoring on the 2nd half of the biscuit.

Bacon was ok
Hash browns were pretty good!
Hollandaise sauce for the benedict was just ok
My over-easy eggs were cooked perfectly though!
Service was great with a girl even walking outside offering umbrella to people waiting in the rain."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Finally got to check out one of the most popular brunch places in Vancouver! My boyfriend and I arrived to this brunch place 20 minutes after it opened up (like around 8am) and there was already a small line out the door. I stood in line for maybe 30 minutes and by then, the line was crazy long.

Upon getting seated, we told our waiter that we had to leave soon because we needed to catch our flight, and the waiters were SO ACCOMMODATING! They ensured that the food would come out faster and even when we ended up taking the food to go, the wrapped it in a nice box for us and included utensils when we didn't ask for that! Service is amazing!

Now onto the food, the pancakes were delish! Add maple syrup to it since Canadian maple syrup is the best. The pancakes were really fluffy. As for the Charlie bowl, it essentially reminds me of all types of breakfasts mixed together into a bowl since it contains biscuit, meats, eggs, etc. it was quite delicious but both me and my boyfriend could not finish either of these plates (and we shared both)! Portions are HUGE! So we had a lot to take home, but it made for a nice dinner :)!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I mean, it's good food, unique, and trendy but NOT worth waiting greater than 45 minutes for. If there is a long ass lineup and the wait is ""45"" it's actually going to be an hour or more and by the time you get in you risk being very hangry. Beware.

Alright now that that is said.... My hubby and I went for my birthday and both got some festive mimosa drinks. The 90s and the lavender. Creative and tasty. 

I ordered the pork belly Benny and wasn't awed by it, but I wanted to try their signature dish since you normally see bacon and/or salmon served at most restaurants. I'd rather go to cafe yen or better yet, botanist for a solid eggs Benedict.
Hubby got the prime meal that makes the visit here worthwhile: the later tater bowl.

Despite being ravenous when we were seated, they were at least pretty speedy in the kitchen and we went on our way carrying home leftovers."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When you see a place opens at 8:00 AM and already has a 40-person lineup at 7:50, you know it's overhyped. And, yes - Jam is overhyped. It will not revolutionize your life, not enough to be worth the absurd lineups that form if you arrive any time after opening.

But it's a damn solid menu, I can tell you that much. I've often avoided brunch because the menus all tend to look the same - a bunch of variations on eggs benny, some sandwiches, one to three variations each of skillets, pancakes, and maybe waffles. Jam still falls into ""high carb North American"" cuisine, but most of the dishes are at the very least twists on the usual, incorporating things like Southern biscuits, naan, tater tots, and deep-fried sausages.

I tried a tater bowl and personally found it good overall - the taters were crunchy and plentiful, and the cheese was a nice touch, though a bit sparse. The pulled pork was fine, but I have to say I've had more flavourful pulled pork at several other places - this was very plain. And the portions are absolutely bonkers - realistically, the Tater Bowl or the Charlie Bowl could handily feed two people. So if you're not blown away, you'll be stuck with a lot of just-okay leftovers.

I also tried the Dutch Baby. I was excited because it's similar to a traditional dish in my family, something we call a Bismarck, a large crispy crêpe/pancake filled with buttery sweets. Unfortunately, the Dutch Baby is definitely not crisp - it's puffy and fairly soggy, and really just okay.

I'm torn on how to rate Jam. I want to give it 4 stars for the creative menu, but I want to give it 3 stars for the food being just fine and for the hype and the wait being very off-putting. I think I'll stick with 3 for now, because I ended up feeling like I'd waited a while for a lot of okay-to-good food, and felt like I would have preferred to pay less for half the portion size rather than get so much of something that wasn't super impressive.

But I do want to go back, because maybe some other menu items will click with me better? That's the draw of a creative menu, I guess!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The Gravy Coop (chicken, sausa) $17 - was a decent biscuits + gravy + chicken meal. The chicken was pretty dry, but the breading was done well and tasty. The gravy was more creamy with less of a meaty taste than i like it.

Brioche French Toast w/ carmelized apples $14.50 - this was so delicious. I gobbled it right up. He bread was soft and soaked with just the right amount of syrup coupled with the slight tangy sweetness from the carmelized apples. Would come again just for this alone.

Pamplemousse Mimosa $7 - was very mediocre. Wasn't t very strong and the bitterness from the grapefruit skin overrode the sweet grapefruit juice that i was hoping for."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"What's your brunch plan on Christas day? @jamcafeyvr is always a good place to be (if you don't mind spending hours to wait in line). Went to Jam Cafe on a rainy weekday for brunch, and was lucky enough that there was only a half an hour line up. Have been here for a couple times, but it was my first time to order their Chicken Waffles and The Three Pigs. The Chicken Waffles were SO GOOD, personally liked this more than their Chicken Toast. The Three Pigs was pretty special too, it's liked some pancakes wrapped around the sausages"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is definitely one of my top 5 restaurants in Vancouver, and one that is worth the hype. Yes, you have to wait in an insanely long line just to get seated, but the food makes up for all of it and more. Prices are reasonable, and portions are massive. Come hungry!

Veggie bowl (5/5)
Guys, I'm still fantasising about this Veggie bowl. Yes, it is literally just a massive bowl of carbs, but who cares? The hash browns could be a little crispier, and there could be more vegetables for my health, but overall it was a delectable dish. The eggs, corn salsa, biscuit and hash browns all added a complexity to the flavours and textures of this bowl. I will 100% get this again. 

Lonely piggy (4/5)
I didn't try this, because I don't like sausages, but everyone else said it was pretty good, just a little on the heavy side because it was kind of oily.

Corned beef hash skillet (3/5)
My brother had this, and he wasn't really the biggest fan of it, but he said it was alright.

Chicken n waffles (3.5/5)
My parents shared this, and they said it was pretty decent. The chicken was not too dry and nicely fried, and the waffle was alright as well.

We couldn't finish everything because the portions are literally gigantic, but if you have a massive appetite like I do - I was the only one who finished everything - come here! And get the Veggie bowl, because it's probably the best thing on the menu. I will be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is my favourite spot for brunch in this city. My go to is the Later Tater Bowl or the Pork Belly Eggs Benedict - and always with the Jam Iced Coffee. I have probably visited half a dozen times and always am happy with the service, food and atmosphere. The only downside is that if you get there past 9:30am, there is a good chance you will be waiting in a long line. So get there early or wait till just before they close. 

I highly recommend checking this place out for a delicious brunch option!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is one of the most popular brunch and foodie spots of Vancouver.

Touristy spot. Expect long lines!!! They open at 8 am, the line probably begins at 7:30 am. Line at 9 am was out the door at least 1-2 hours long. I ordered to go so I did not have to do the wait. 

Inside is pretty small and tight. Seating is pretty limited, maybe max 20 parties.

Food did not take long to be ready after I called. Less then 20 minutes.

Limited street parking on the main street, always packed for Jam. You might have to park way down or around the corner. It is paid meters. 

Old Town Breakfast - $13.50 - Great basic breakfast plate. Eggs were cooked perfectly, light and fluffy. Bacon was thick and salty, good crisp. Hash browns were crispy. 

Fried Chicken Benedict - $16 - Perfectly poached egg. Chicken was nicely fried. I liked the little seasoning on the egg. Corn was a nice texture change. Hollandaise was creamy and rich. Comes with hash browns and fruit.

Red Velvet Pancake - $6 + $3 - Popular but I thought it was just ok. Large pancake. Thick but more dense then fluffy. Strong cocoa flavor. Cream cheese sauce was sweet, gave it the red velvet cupcake feel."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came back to Jam after so long, and its still really great, especially the Charlie Bowl. That has the biggest bang for your buck - grab a friend to share.

We also tried a seasonal smoked salmon waffle thing they had. It was solid, but nothing mind blowing. 

I would say if there is a wait, I personally would not bother, but on the right time and occasion, Jam Cafe is a great place to hit up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"With all of the hype that has been constantly going around about Jam Cafe, we decided to build up the courage and try it out on a Friday morning. We got there around 10am and waited a bit over an hour. It was cold and drizzling but we knew we had to endure it. We felt lucky because we weren't even the last people in line. 

The menu is very extensive and I think that's what caught my eye because there is so many options and I had heard the portions are HUGE. I am not a very picky eater so it was hard for me to decide what to eat! I knew I should try something different and popular. 

My mom had the feature early grey French toast. I'm not usually a fan but it was delicious. I had the tater tot bowl and I was not disappointed and I knew it would be good anyways because who doesn't love tater tots! 

My only small complaint would be that the price for a side of eggs- it said 2 even though she wanted one- was $5!! That's insane. And I did love the food, but I don't think I could wait that long in line unless they implemented testing so I could walk around downtown and know when I should come back"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I made a plan to come here the moment I read about it. My fiance and I got up at 7 so we could walk the 1.8 km to get here by 7:45 AM. We got here at 7:46 AM and there was already a line. We were maybe the 8th group in line?

Once they opened, we were seated immediately. It wasn't quite filled up but by 8:15 AM, more people started trickling in till there was a line/wait by 8:30 AM. The menu is pretty extensive. I'm normally a sweet breakfast person opposed to savory, but decided to go with the Charlie Bowl after seeing so many good reviews. Fiance got the chicken and waffles. I was tempted to get a side of pancakes but ultimately decided to save room for other food later on. 

Our food came out in an average amount of time. The Charlie Bowl is HUGE. I didn't even get through half of it. Crumbled up biscuits (more like chunks of biscuits), hash browns, gravy, some sort of salsa? ham, cheese, and two over easy eggs. It was very very tasty, the biscuits were fluffy. Although I do wish the biscuits were a little more flavorful. And wish there was more gravy. I liked the jalepeno hot sauce and ended up using a lot of it. The fiance loved his chicken and waffles, but only got through a little more than half. The waffles were a good texture, slight crunch to them. Yum. 

I saw some people get the french toast and chicken which was even bigger. I do wish I would have gone the sweet route, but there is always next time! It does take some planning to get here as you'll have a huge wait if you don't show up when they open. I do like that they have blankets hanging on the seats closest to the door as it is constantly being open. At the time, there was plenty of street parking as well. I don't know if I would make a special trip back here and deal with the line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Awesome breakfast dishes at a great price.

We wanted breakfast and awoke in the Hyatt to see a typical expensive and small breakfast buffet. We travelled into Vancouver looking for an alternative, but found many Denny's-like breakfast spots. Luckily, highly-rated Jam Cafe was a winner.

I had the chicken French toast. It was piled-high with thick bread and tasty chicken. I have never had pickled cabbage on French toast before, and the maple bourbon BBQ glaze/honey sauce was not overly sweet. Great overall taste.

We all enjoyed our meals...awesome food at a great price. The service was also very good. Great recommendations and I was given a coffee for the road.

The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small. You may have a short wait outside before a table is available."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There was quite a line when I arrived here, even after 10 AM. Having said that, it moved quickly and I didn't wait more than about 20 minutes--though I hear that can be a lot worse on the weekends. In any case, I lucked into a two-top next to various nice folks with whom I chatted periodically. My friendly server helped me settled on the smoked salmon benedict with the addition of avocado. It was a tasty dish--not the best I've ever had, but very good--and the avo definitely lends more substance to it (it's not a huge portion of smoked salmon itself)--and the egg helped tie everything together. When I first sat down, everyone around me had some sort of benedict, and I can see why. Having said that, when the table on my left turned and a French toast arrived, that looked awfully delicious.

All in all, I think this is a nice brunch spot with a relaxed vibe, though whether it's worth a long wait in line...not sure. I'd certainly come back if the wait time weren't any longer than today."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We went to this place on a Thursday for brunch. The line wasn't bad but still long. We waited about 20 minutes but according to other reviews the line could be even longer!

We got the B.E.L.T.C.H, the fried chicken benedict, a side of corn bread, and a Jammer mimosa. Everything was so delicious. The only thing is that I wished my hashbrowns were crispier, but I should have asked for them to be. 

If I'm ever in the area again and have time to wait, I'd go back to try more items off the menu."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long lines are always expected when going to Jam Cafe on Beatty St. so the hubby and I go whenever we're both suffering from jet lag -- it allows us to wake up really early to line up before they open so we get a table on the first seating. Our technique worked and we were also able to get street parking near the cafe -- double score! 

This time around we ordered the following: half Smoked Salmon Benny (for me), Herald Street omelette and a side of Banana Walnut pancake (for the hubby). Loved my half smoked salmon benny -- serving size was just enough for me and I loved it! The hollandaise was well made and the potato hash was a great accompaniment. The hubby enjoyed his omelette but the star of our meal was the banana walnut pancake -- the caramelised bananas with the walnut plus maple syrup was a wonderful treat to end our meal. 

Always a pleasant experience at Jam Cafe and I look forward to coming back again soon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Massively overrated and overpriced. The food is ok, but I'm not sure why people want to wait 90+ minutes for bland food and terrible service. Lots of better, cheaper options."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Never disappoints! Number one place for me! Large portion and delicious! 
Fried chicken with waffles, triple stacked pancakes, Charlie Bowl... So many delicious options!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cool and amazing! The spot was so nice and pretty popular. The interior was great and the ambiance was classy and casual. The food they served was so good and delicious and perfect for Brunch, it's pretty pricy too but very worth it. The drinks here were so good too and tasty and the presentation was excellent. The service was good and so accommodating and the staff was very friendly and nice to the customer. Jam Cafe on Beatty is truly amazing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I LOVE IT. 

Our last full day in Vancouver and we decided to come to Jam Cafe after looking at all the mouth watering photos on Yelp. You can tell they're poppin' because their line was out the door and we waited about 20-25 minutes before we were able to get a table. And that was also because we were only 2 people vs. a larger group. 

Their menu is extensive. Their options are endless. They have so much stuff on the walls to look at and their workers are just the friendliest. I don't remember exactly what I got, but you can see the photos and honestly just give this place a chance because it's worth the wait. 

Their prices are justified because their portions are absolute huge. Almost to the point where you may want to share your plate instead of getting your own, but still get your own because you like options and can't be tied down to just one thing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Decent food. Great service and vibe. 

London fog latte: really loved. Very light and not too sweet. 

Cinnamon cream cheese pancake: loved. Super sweet but delicious. We ordered a single stack as another reviewer recommended since the topping is only on the top pancake anyway. Would def order again.

Tater bowl: average. Tater tots were nice and crisp. Eggs were overdone and not runny. The pork is subtly sweet and tastes great. However, altogether wasn't super impressed with the bowl. I'd skip it next time

Fried chicken eggs Benedict: decent. Chicken breading doesn't taste like much but the overall fish is okay. I'd skip it next time"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's been over a year and a half since I wrote my review on Jam and since then I've still loved coming here. I take all my friends from out of town here. I wait in the lines just so I can have their candied bacon garnished caesar and amazingly delicious, food coma-worthy charlie bowl. I don't care if you think the line is stupid or if you think this is over-rated, I just love Jam so freaking much. 

A few notes since my last review: 
+ They have now opened up a new location in Kitsilano. 
+ Their candied bacon is still the best bacon in the city. 
+ Their eggs benedict, chicken and french toast, and pancakes are also winners in my book. 
+ They have lunch features that are great as well - I'd recommend the mac n cheese grilled cheese, the king chicken sandwich, or the buffalo blue sandwich. If you're looking for something lighter then, the big jam salad is the bomb.com!  
+ Service is always spectacular - shout out to the wonderful servers who get people in and out quickly with never making us feel rushed. 

I think I am officially in a relationship with this brunch hot spot. They have my heart forever."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I have a habit of taking all of my coworkers on Yelp adventures during our business trips. Sometimes it doesn't work out (when you boss doesn't want to wait in line for instance), and other times like Jam, you get extra brownie points for taking the crew to a delicious meal. 

We strolled up to Jam around 7:45 on a weekday, hoping to get in and out just before our 9am meeting down the street. There was a small line forming and I was worried we wouldn't make it, but some people didn't want to sit at the bar, so we lucked out with a great seat. 

The food was amazing, and I love all things brunch. I had the baked oatmeal, which was the best freakin' oatmeal I've ever had, and probably ever will have. It was more like a moist banana bread consistency. My boss had the banana pancakes and couldn't stop talking about them all trip. All hail Jam!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I love chicken French toast which took a while to arrive but then again the place was packed. The fried chicken was crispy and tender, the French toast was fluffy soft. They made a good pair. The portion was quite big so go hungry. You will be hangry anyway as there is always a line outside.

I saw someone ordered the Charlie Bowl and that looked really yummy. I would want to try that another time. If only the line was not so long. Even on weekday before the usual lunch hours, there was a line waiting. 

You need lots of patience if you want to dine here."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Things that blew me away:

Jam coffee
London Fog
Caesar (I asked for extra pickled asparagus *drools*)
Triple stack pancakes with Maple Butter (heavenly)


Things that were bleh:

Chicken and French toast 
1 hour wait to be sat 
Cinnamon pancakes (too sweet)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"WOW. Just WOW.

I waited in line for almost 2 hours on a Sunday for this restaurant and IT WAS WORTH IT. 

Right when my roommate and I got a table the waitress was SO friendly and quickly took our drink order - their take on a Bloody Mary and a mimosa. 

I ordered the Bloody Mary because I knew it came with some bacon and I was starving by this point - it was AHHHHMAZING. This drink came with a huggeeee piece of maple bacon that was cooked perfectly and the drink had the best flavor everrrrr because of the touch of added clam juice.

For the meal, I got the farmer's skillet and shared the cinnamon swirl pancakes with my friend. SO FREAKIN GOOD. I'm allergic to gluten but I tried the pancakes and am so happy I did because they were some of the most moist and flavorful I've ever had.

Overall, this place is well worth the wait - I would happily do so once a week if there was one near me."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited 1 hour for brunch at Jam Cafe on a weekend. Interior is rustic and cute.

We ordered the chicken french toast ($18) and buffalo fried chicken eggs benny ($17). The chicken french toast was very unique - chicken is fried well and the maple bourbon BBQ glaze is interesting. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the buffalo sauce and goat cheese on the eggs benny. 

Food is good but not sure if it's really worth a 1 hour wait (lineup is outside on the street). Nice to try if you've never been but it's hard to go there as a regular due to the long wait time.

Full review and pics on my blog:

Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This has been a long time coming -- one of the reasons I've been putting this off is because I refuse to wait in long lines, and the line here has been consistently long. The day I went here there was no line; and I'd like to add that my experience here was great. At the end of the review I will try to answer the question, ""would it be worth the wait?""

Food 5/5 -- very rare for me to rate this well on food quality, but here it is. Loved it. I got a Hot Chocolate French toast, which was the French Toast special. I had gone in craving waffles and fried chicken so I opted to add a side of buttermilk fried chicken breast. My girlfriend got chicken and waffles. But she did have a bit of commentary.

Let's just say my French Toast was a huge portion, and exactly the kind of thing I love -- I'm not huge on sweets, but I love s'mores, and this definitely fulfilled that craving. The fried chicken breast was also awesome. Quite moist, and tasty breading. My girlfriend who is also quite picky loved her chicken and waffles. She also mentioned how happy she was with the moistness of the chicken, but felt she was desiring or more crunchiness. She wasn't totally sold on the waffles either. Her words were that it wasn't the way she preferred them but it was still very good (she's a red seal chef, so I would say she's hyper aware of her own tastes, but also recognizes when something is made well even if not to her tastes.)

Service 4.5/5 -- pains me a little bit not to give perfect service scores on such a great experience. There was a good number of staff working but it still seemed like they were a bit slow to approach our table, and take orders. It wasn't particularly busy either -- everything else was perfect and by the book.

Cleanliness 5/5 -- spot on. And the bathroom was pretty cool. Had a '60s style white type decor with decorative bread pans. While I took a leak I felt as if I could close my eyes and relieve my bladder to the aromas of freshly baked bread. Cool mirrors too! 

Atmosphere 5/5 -- pretty much everything you would want in brunch place decor. Wood tables with booth seating for the gals and chairs for the guys. Bar looked cool as well. Might want to check bar seating out some day.

Overall 4.9 -- I grappled with the idea of bumping this up to a 5 star review. But there are two reasons I didn't. Before I get into those reasons I would like to briefly mention that I've stated previously that I don't like to round up 4 point reviews to 5, because I don't want to give the impression that something scored 100% by my experience. However, I had considered making an exception for Jam, because this is really close and it only narrowly missed because of service.

Nevertheless here are the two reasons: first, I considered that one of the benefits of yelp is that it tells business owners an area they can improve, and I want them to notice this review for that reason. Secondly -- even though I don't like rounding up 4 star reviews, I do have a tendency to round up from my four separate categories, so if it's a good experience then my rating is already stacked in their favour.

Lastly I will answer ""would it be worth the wait?"" There's a couple ways I'm going to answer this question. First I'll start with the favourable answer. This is the best brunch place I've been to in Vancouver, so in that sense it is worth the wait. The more pragmatic view however -- even though brunch is a pretty big deal in Vancouver, I believe that most good brunch places have an unreasonably long wait.  Simply put, I don't think there are enough brunch places, so in that sense it is not worth the wait... it is very good, however I don't think more than 30 mins wait time is reasonable."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"At first we were skeptical about coming here despite the hype just because we HATE lining up for anything especially outside when it's raining. However, we finally decided to jump the gun and to our surprise, our 40 minute wait outside went by sort of fast. So I'd suggest coming here with really good company so that your conversations can shorten the wait time hahaha. The host of the restaurant also offered the people in the line up with umbrellas to borrow as it was pouring so we thought that was a nice gesture. On a random note, we also saw KJ Apa nearby the area! Maybe this is his brunch spot of choice...

FOOD// We got a side of tater tots and one cinnamon bun pancake to share, as well as the Chicken n Waffles and the Smoked Salmon benny. Although it was a lot of food, we were able to finish everything because it was soooo good! The tater tots are very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were the perfect size for us to snack on as we waited for our main dishes. I wasn't fond of the hashbrown that came with the benny but that's because I just prefer cut potatoes more in general. But it still tasted good! Their house hollaindaise sauce is one of the best ones I've tried as it was light yet creamy. For the Chicken x Waffles, you get to enjoy a juicy, tender piece of waffles made with a soft, inviting batter that I'm sure you'd eat up 100%.

The cinnamon bun pancakes are also to DIE FOR. The size is as big as the plate so one was enough for us. You get the sweet goodness taste of cinnamon buns with the light, airy, and fluffy of the pancake dough!  

Lastly, Jam Cafe also has the BEST hot sauce made out of jalapenos! As spicy food fanatics (well, moreso Flo), this made us very happy. So when you go, don't forget to try it out. 

SERVICE/// Really friendly service. The food came really fast and they refilled our water constantly without us asking. Despite the busyness, our waitress still paid really good attention to us making sure everything was tasting okay. 

--  Overall, we would go back here again but go earlier in the day as I hear the wait time is faster in the morning compared to early afternoon (we went at ~12:30 PM). Definitely worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Three words: Later Tater Bowl. Ridiculously good. Tater tots, eggs, pulled pork. It's spicy and filling, and the portion size is really generous. I know the line outside is intimidating, but if you come for second seating after they open (like an hour after they open)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Firstly, expect to wait here if you have a group. I was lucky enough to skip the line since I was one person and a spot at the bar was open. 

I ordered half salmon Jam Benny, chicken French toast, and side of biscuit and gravy. The salmon Jam Benny is one of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. Everything else was not that great in my opinion. I should have gotten a more traditional French toast. And, biscuit and gravy was good but similar to others I've had. 

I had ice coffee was perfect but might be sweet for some."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Waited for about an hour to be seated but was well worth the wait! Had the fried chicken eggs Benedict and it was delicious! The perfect crunch to the chicken mixed with the great tasting hollandaise sauce was perfect! Strongly recommend this breakfast spot.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The line up is ridiculous but the food was spectacular. Service was really great as well!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My boyfriend and I were in Vancouver on a little 3 day getaway. We had an Airbnb that was pretty close to this location, so we decided to give it a try. I AM SO GLAD WE DID. We both agreed that this is ""our"" breakfast spot, and if we are in Vancouver it is one of the places on our must stop list. 

We had to wait for a table, but anything this amazing is well worth the wait. It was probably about an hour for a table on a Tuesday, so come early for you will be stuck standing in the rain for awhile. 

I ordered a regular mimosa to drink. It was delicious. They used pulpy orange juice, and it was pretty strong. By my second one I realized I was kind of drunk before 12.. but hey.. we were on vacation after all ‍ my boyfriend ordered the Caesar. I usually don't like them, but it was actually way better than anything I've had in the states.

For the food, I had the chicken cordon bleu eggs benny. It was the special of the day. It was cooked to freaking perfection. My mouth is watering thinking about how amazing it was. The chicken was so flavorful and fried perfectly. WHEN I return, I'll probably do the salmon eggs benny, but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork pancakes. They were SO good. The pancake was nice and fluffy, the pulled pork was electrifying with flavor, and they put a maple BBQ sauce on top that I would eat everyday for the rest of my life if I could. 

All in all, this is a must try/stop if you are in the area. Don't get frustrated with the line. It's a small restaurant, and totally worth every cold second in the rain!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best atmosphere ever
Best pancakes ever
Best London fogs ever
Best line up ever lol (((=
I love there so much!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It was worth the wait.  I went for breakfast on a Friday morning and was surprised that they had a line.  We contemplated going elsewhere but I'm super happy that we decided to stick with it.  The line moved quickly, the staff were very friendly and the food was awesome!  Our group of five got several different items and everything was perfectly seasoned.  Highlights include the classic Caesars, iced coffee and the two bowls.  Our server Noel was super attentive and funny.  The atmosphere was very cute and the dining room was quieter than expected even though it was always full.  I will gladly come when I'm back in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It isn't often that I'll wake up at 0700 and walk half a mile in the freezing cold to get breakfast, but the hype behind Jam Cafe on Beatty was simply too much to pass up. In conclusion, it was worth the early morning, but my Charlie Bowl didn't quite rank among my most favorite breakfast dishes. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Yes, the line at Jam Cafe can easily grow to be in excess of two hours, but the staff are great about managing expectations. With an 0800 opening time, I lined up at 0745 and was seated at the bar as a single in the first wave of diners on a Sunday morning. From there everything was pretty much perfect. You've got a great atmosphere, great staff, and great service. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

I paid $16.00 for the highly touted Charlie Bowl, and that turned out to be a bargain when measured against the quantity of food that I got. This bowl could have and probably should have covered two full meals. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

This was an excellent breakfast bowl, but how could it not be? With eggs, bacon, hash browns, and biscuits all in the mix with some housemade jalapeno sauce and maple syrup there's no way this could have been anything but excellent. My one criticism was that it tasted pretty much as though it was just a sum of its parts. I would have loved for some unique ingredient to really pull this together as a unique dish; and while I thought I would find that element with the jalapeno hot sauce I didn't really. Even so excellent. Single Star. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Absolutely. Line aside, Jam Cafe checks all the boxes. Star."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is definitely a hidden gem in Vancouver. I stumbled upon this very cute (and small) restaurant when I was looking for good quality brunch. 

The atmosphere was very cozy, the restaurant isn't that large, and the walls are covered in outdoorsy/hipster decorations that make the place feel homey...almost like a cabin. 

The food was phenomenal and the portions were quite large. I got the Gravy Coops which was biscuits and sausage gravy with fried chicken, 2 eggs, and a side of hash browns. The biscuits are HUGE and the sausage gravy was the best I've had in awhile. They also have mushroom gravy available. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy and not too greasy. As I said, I didn't finish my food and that rarely happens. I wish I could've finished because it was amazing. 

If you're ever in Vancouver definitely check this place out! They have a large, diverse menu with reasonable prices and 2 daily specials if you want to change things up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came here on Friday at 9 AM and there was already a long line forming out the door. I waited about 50 minutes outside before I got seated. When my party got seated we promptly ordered because there were menus outside to decide what you want while you eat. We ordered the tater bowl, pulled pork pancake, chicken and waffles, pork belly eggs Benedict, and jam iced coffee. 

Jam Iced Coffee:
When I ordered this, I thought it actually had jam in it but then I realized it was just the name of the place lol. The iced coffee was good, it had a sweet flavor that paired well with the slight bitterness from the coffee. It was more sweet than bitter.

Chicken and Waffles:
The chicken and the gravy was great. It was crunchy, tender, and had lots of flavor. However, the waffle was a little soggy and rubbery -- maybe it was because we ate the chicken first. 

Tater Bowl:
This was very filling because of all the taters. It was very rich. The bowl is quite large and is packed with taters, meat, and topped with an egg. However, it is pretty dry making it kind of hard to eat.

Pork Belly eggs Benedict:
The pork belly was seasoned well, a little on the saltier side. The pork belly was more on the drier side. The eggs Benedict were great, cooked and seasoned well. 

Pulled Pork pancakes:
This was a good mix of savory and sweet. The sauce on the pulled pork was sweet but not overpowering the taste of the pork itself. The pulled pork was soft and easy to chew. The pancakes were fluffy and had a good texture."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had the pork belly eggs benny - the crispy pork skin was SO GOOD! The Charlie Bowl was also really good.  I highly recommend this place, even though there is always line-up to get in."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came on Saturday around 8.30 AM and the line wasn't long.
Actually at first the line moved pretty quick until when we actually was in front, the server keeps calling the people with party of 2 (we were party of 3). She did mention that the bigger table is full. I mean I would understand, but most restaurant usually merge 2 tables to one. She skipped us with FIVE party of 2 table, so that adds another 30-40 mins for us. At first I didn't mind, but it's getting ridiculous LOL.
Anyway, we ordered the chorizo benedict and of course, Charli Bowl. The chorizo benedict is good, but the charli bowl was tasty!! Actually we were glad we split since the portion is quite big, and the bowl is pretty creamy. Then we can continue to our food adventure :)
Overall, this place is good, server is so nice, food came pretty fast.. I took 1* off for the waiting method (for skipping the party instead of merging the tables)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Let's talk about the banana strawberry French toast on a nice thick slice of bread. The banana were warm and perfect with the slight crutch to the French toast. And the strawberries with the maple Syrup and powdered sugar. Mmmmm couldn't get enough. 
The BEST blackberry Jam to go on toast. It was Tarty and not overwhelming sweet. Taste so fresh! 

* would have given 5 stars but the OJ was just ok. 

Cute place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The line is always very long (around an hour), so we ordered takeout which is much quicker. 
I got the King Chicken burger (16$) with sweet potato fries (3$) and waffle on the side (6$). I have no complaints whatsoever. Everything was so delicious, it was absolutely the best brunch I've ever had in my life."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe seems like a very popular breakfast spot in the area.  We decided to go have breakfast since our tour bus pick up was scheduled for later in the morning. It was a 15 minutes walk from our hotel in downtown.  I was surprised to see a line of about 20 in front of the restaurant at 1000am.  All the locals and tourists were out having breakfast here.  

There is no wait list.  You must stand in line and wait to be seated.  It took about 40 minutes until we got a table.  I didn't mind the wait because I love the breakfast/brunch thing.  The cafe is small hence the long wait.  

The menu is extensive with so many breakfast and lunch options.  I already knew what I wanted to order after browsing through the Yelp photos.  It was so difficult to decide since everything looks so delicious!  

Our breakfast order:
*****Smoked salmon Benedict:: poached eggs with Steelhead smoked salmon, cream cheese over a toasted English muffin.  Add the sliced avocado.  So good!!!  I like that they allow you to order half. 

****Harrison salmon scramble:: scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, onions, cream cheese on multi grain toast.  Served with a bean salad in house vinaigrette.  Healthy and good!

Jam Cafe is breakfast done right.  All entrees were tasty!  Service was excellent.  One of the best breakfast spots I've been to.  It's worth the long wait!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My family and I have never waited as long as We did but we really wanted to explore Jam Cafe based on the yelp reviews  and we will always remember this as one of the best Vancouver experiences we had! 

The food was definitely worth the wait! My family and I ordered:

Coffees - Yum! 

Raspberry and lemon pancakes - omg, so yummy! Tart but not too tart. The lemon complimented the fruit really well! The quantity however was a little overwhelming :) 

Huevos Racheros - Flavor explosion and very tempting in presentation! Loved it!

Cinnamon Bun Pankcakes - 

We also had a Benny's special of the day which was super delicious and mind blowing! 

Overall, great experience! Thank you Jam, for a memorable brunch time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I don't understand how a single breakfast can haunt my dreams for over a year, but somehow that's exactly what Jam does. Whether it's the Kits or the downtown location, I find myself thirsty for Jam constantly. It's an obsession, really."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My partner and I were in town for one day while waiting to board our cruise ship and this place was highly recommended. We got there just a few minutes after 8am (when they opened) and just missed getting in to the first seating and then had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. The food was worth the wait (but maybe not much longer )  I had the smoked salmon scramble, which came with a lovely little salad and he had the Farmer's Scramble, which he described as two pounds of food lol! 

We would have given them 5 stars but there were no gluten-free options (we're gf) and the long wait. We'd come back again on a future trip but would plan our timing differently."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Only taking a star off because the line was insanely long. Staff are really great about it, but still.

Went here with a group of friends when we came to visit Vancouver. Honestly staff were so nice in trying to accommodate us, it made for a better experience. It's a small little restaurant so I can see why the lines occur, but still crazy. We were all kind of hangry by the time we got in lol. 

As for food- delicious. I have no complaints with food and service. Everyone and everything on the plates were amazing!!! I can definitely see why there are lines. Ordered a lot of different items. Everyone of us had satisfied stomachs by the time we left. Would tell you that pancakes are a must! Even if you share, it was good!!!!

Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Vancouver area and have the time to wait in line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I just had to see what the fuss was about, especially because there was STILL a line on a Thursday morning at 9:30 in the pouring rain. So I waited. I got a spot fairly quickly at the bar as I was by myself, but other groups of 4 were being told it was at least a 30 min wait. 

I got a boozy drink with a shot of espresso and steamed milk. I definitely ordered wrong because it was not what I wanted at all. It was called Morning Glory. It was just nothing special, I have had better. 

I got the Harrison's Smoked Salmon to eat and it was VERY tasty. The salad was also delish but I couldn't finish it. 

I would try Jam Cafe again, but only if it was a short wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place had been on my list for long and but I was always scared by the long waiting queue in front of the restaurant. Finally one day I decided to take the plunge and stood in the queue. After waiting for an hour finally we were seated. 
Despite the heavy crowd, servers are really attentive. We ordered corn bread, blueberry pancakes and a skillet along with coffee. Food arrived fast. Corn bread tasted really good. However, I was really disappointed with the pancakes. They were dense and I love fluffy pancakes. Also the blueberry compote did not taste good.
Skillet tasted good. The amount of food you get is more than enough for one person. We took leftovers to go as well."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went to JAM on the weekend and it was PACKED! The reviews were right - the line up outside is insanely long as this is one of the recommended brunch spots (and rightfully so!).

My group of friends and I lined up for about 30 minutes before we were seated. It was raining slightly that morning, so the wait outside was not too pleasant (especially since we hadn't had any type of food in our stomachs yet!). To my pleasant surprise, the staff were handing out their delicious french toasts cut into pieces while we all waited in line. That was definitely a nice touch on their end. 

Brunch is my favourite meal of the day and my go to is always eggs Benedict. That particular day, I was also craving chicken and waffles, so when I saw that there was an option for fried chicken benedict ($16), I knew that was what I needed to get. It did not disappoint one bit!

Would most certainly return - just hope the line won't be too long next time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Nice little cafe but the lineup to get in is too long. Portions are quite large. Bacon could be cooked more. But overall great little place
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I always wanted to come here with my Yelper friends. The only issue was the line up. I had in mind coming here during lunch time but the line up would just deter my colleague and I away. Weekend doesn't really work well for me because I seem to have millions of things to do than lining up. Finally after months and months of hoping to try this place out, I finally found the time. I came here with a friend. I had a good look at the menu for over 30 mins outside waiting. 

After  contemplating for such a longtime, we have decided to get the Charlie Bowl and Chicken French Toast to share. I personally love salmon benedict but the thing is that I can get that anywhere. 

So for the Charlie Bowl: First things that came to mind was that there were too much carbs. It was like having a stuffing bowl. I didn't like it too much. 
The Chicken French Toast was delicious. I liked the fried chicken. The portion was super big. I am not complaining but I do wish there were less French Toasts or smaller slice or thinner slice of French Toast because I couldn't finish it and it went to waste. I personally don't like to waste food. 

Overall, the place was good. I would like to try to Victoria location to see if it is the same or comparable."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"40 minute wait was so worth it! My husband and I shard the waffle board with strawberries and apples, and the pulled pork pancakes...yep we had to walk it off!! Yummy"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"They offer a fantastic breakfast and brunch menu. The line ups are long during weekends. I waited about 50 minutes to be seated. Once seated, menus and water were dropped off fairly quickly. We ordered chicken n' waffles, buttermilk biscuit melt and a lonely piggy.

Overall, the food was great. My only complaint was that the waffle did not taste fresh. It tasted as though it was made earlier in the day and had lost its crispness. The fried chicken was nicely seasoned. The lonely piggy was an upgrade from the basic corn dog. It was a maple sausage fried in a pancake batter. It paired nicely with the maple butter dip. The biscuits melt was tasty. The biscuit was flaky goodness. The tomato jam was interesting as I never tried that before, but tomato and eggs always goes well hand in hand.

If you have a lot of time and plan to spend the day in downtown, I would recommend trying this restaurant if you do not mind the line ups. I usually do not like to wait too long but once in awhile is worth the foodie goodness."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So so good!!!! If I can give it more stars, I totally would.  The only bad thing is there is quite a wait, but that's a good sign, right???
Just go!  You won't regret it!  My family ordered 4 different dishes and we all loved it.
Generous portions too.  Just go!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Do add this place as to do list while in Vancouver.  All the good reviews were spot on. Great food, big portion, nice all around decor for a diner and friendly staff as well. 
Do get here before 8 to assure you a table or seats at the bar. We got here at 8:03 and the line outside already forming (luckily my wife and I got the last seats by the bar; poor guy who was in front of us but had to wait because his partner was not present). 
On to the review on the food: spectacular; big portions, savory Charlie bowl and sweet Crackerjack should be part of your consideration. Although one can argue that there are other places serve as good breakfast like this place, the hype adds to the place deserving a high on your to visit while in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"5 Stars for the best brunch of my life. No exaggeration. 

First thing's first- there will be a wait. We waited about 45 mins and it was worth twice that amount of time. 

Our server, Diana (with the sweet chihuahua tattoo), was an absolute pleasure! She helped guide us towards the best dishes and joked around with us. When a restaurant us so busy, often the service is all work and no play. This wasn't the case here. Efficient, but suuuuper fun and friendly.

But now the real goods. The food and bevies. Pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but here are a few of my favorite things:

Cinnamon Swirl Pancake-- Nothing in my life has ever tasted better than this. How they got a perfectly crispy outer layer on these pancakes is one of life's great mysteries. I can honestly say that several months later, I'm still dreaming about those pancakes.

The Charlie Bowl-- Damn. This thing is big. And beautiful. A hearty mixture of breakfast faves: biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, salsa, onions, etc. It's savory sin in a bowl. And I'm here for it. 

Caesar (beverage)-- Vancouver's version of a Bloody Mary, but with clam broth mixed in with the tomato juice. Also, with a sugar bacon slice. Is it treacherous to say I'd take this over a Bloody Mary all day? If so... Lock. This. Little. Lady. Up.

Overall, a phenomenal brunch that I will 100% repeat any time I'm in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Beat breakfast place. Every minute wait is worth it. You turnover is pretty quickly so just get in this line. Also really good service, we love the girl behind the bar. I am already happy with just avotoast and poached eggs but their pancakes are insane."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cute little spot, hubby and I found on our way to the FlyOver Canada ride. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was quaint. It does have items for purchase like Olive oil and cookbooks. Recommend this place to everyone! We were very happy :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait was about 40 minutes and we arrived 30 minutes after it opened. The place is small so it gets full quickly. I got an egg white omelet and it was fine, nothing to brag about. My fiancé had the tater tot bowl and it was huge. It had great flavor though and he loves it. The pulled pork was really good. It's a good brunch place, the service could be better though."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brunch is my most favorite meal of the weekend. Brunch at Jam Café was by far, my most favorite meal of my trip to Vancouver. 

I'm in impatient person and prefer to make a resi than wait in line for my table but if you take anything away from this review it is that - JAM CAFÉ IS WORTH THE LINE! 

A group of five of us headed over for Sunday brunch and waited about 30-45 min to be seated. We got a corner table by the window which made for epic food photos.

We started with Caesars. These Caesars were so yummy- served in the cutest mason jar glass, with sugar cured bacon. After my first sip I knew brunch was off to a good start.

WHAT WE ATE:
- cinnamon swirl pancakes: woah. Mind blown with these and I am not a sweet breakfast person. These were served with a cream cheese swirl and a great bite. 
- charlie bowl: this is filled with goodness- I'm taking ham, bacon, biscuits, gravy, cheese, eggs and I am sure that I'm missing more things. It is a HEARTY portion. I got my own but with all the plates we had going around, this could certainly be shared.
- pigs in a blanket: I was so full, but enjoyed my bite of sausage wrapped in a pancake. 
- chicken and waffles: I didn't try this, but it looked beautiful and delicious.


The service was super friendly, and pretty speedy too. Even tho there was a line out the door, they didn't rush you out and let you enjoy your food and conversation. 

Our host, Issabelle F, went home with all our leftovers and I would say she truly won the day. Oh Jam Cafe, how sad I am I can't order the Charlie Bowl in Miami. Vancouver is lucky to have you."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"HODOR-Line (Stay in the line; it is worth it)

The prices are fair and the food is honestly very good! The benny's are perfectly made and the staff is nice and always around."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"They're not kidding when people say this is one of the most popular brunch spots in Vancouver. 

We were well prepared to give this place a try to see what the fuzz is about that we were committed to come lineup before their 8am opening. When we were here at about 7:45am there were already about 10 people in front of us on a Tuesday morning, and gradually there were more people arriving for the first dibs on the seats.

After we got seated and settled down, I got to take a look at their menu. I think generally their items were a dollar or two more expensive than other brunch spots, and unfortunately, there weren't any photos on the menu to see how the food look like. 

I ordered the fried chicken benedict and a milk shake. The milk shake came pretty quickly and I liked that they not only give you the drink but also any leftover milk shake in another cup so you' sure to get what you paid for. The food dishes took longer to arrive, possibly after 15-20mins after ordering due to how busy the restaurant was. My eggs benedict tasted great but I felt the fried chicken too be too dry and overcooked, such that it was very difficult to cut the chicken and the texture wasn't great. 

My friend who ordered a French toast complained that hers didn't have much eggs covering the toast. I agreed with her after taking a bite, as you can clearly tell they didn't dip the bread in the eggs enough, which led to it not turning out like a traditional French toast. 

Overall, I don't think Jam Cafe is really THAT good to warrant the hype and the long waits. The food tasted kinda mediocre to me and I didn't like how dry my chicken was. Also, I got an upset stomach shortly after and I was certain that the food at Jam Cafe was the only thing I ate that day when I got the upset stomach. Would not recommend coming here and wait at the lines."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I was trying to stay away from StarYucks and found this plcce. Ordered a toffee nut mocha and surprisingly not overly sweet. My new go to
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The only thing not awesome about this place is the wait. I'd say be there before opening, otherwise plan on 30-40 minutes of sidewalk time. The food is gorgeous, hearty, and flavorful. The service is friendly, yet prompt, and the environment is warm and inviting."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I love the idea of the Jam Cafe because the menu, of course, is phenomenal, and the popularity can be noted by the long lineups alone. I think the Benny's are delicious and the corned beef hash is worth ordering again and again. Be forewarned the pancakes are literally massive cakes, and the portions are huge. The sweet orders (pancakes, waffles, French toast) are not for the faint of stomach, but still heavenly desserts on a plate. 
I recommend going, trying and loving the Jam cafe, but I personally wouldn't wait in line for another round. 

Excellent as a one-hit-wonder, or great as a repeat place if you have the time."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Finally got around to checking this place out! Been past the area many times, and the huge line (which is constant at ANY time of day) always scares me away. Well today I successfully made it inside, and overall I think it was worth it! 

I waited approx 40 min in the rain. The staff gave out spare umbrellas to people in line, which was a thoughtful and special touch. When inside, the atmosphere is warm and cozy. The menu was surprisingly robust, and there's a lot to choose from for both the sweet tooths and savoury lovers. I went straight for the chicken and French toast,  and shared the cinnamon pancakes. The portions are huge, so consider sharing if you are with others! Even the one chicken French toast was too much for me, and I can eat a big meal myself. The food was excellent, and I definitely agree with the high ratings of the place. Also, I was very happy with the service. 

All in all, it was a great experience, and I think worth a wait of max 30 min. I think Jam meets expectations - excellent all around, but not mind blowing and not overrated either. Def consider going if you want a solid brunch and willing to wait a while, esp on a nice day (prob don't come if you're already starving). Would come back for sure, and best to come with a few others so you can chat while in line!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you're going to come to this place make sure and scheduled to be here when it opens to avoid the long line.

Well the line really isn't that long it just takes a long time to turn over the tables in this small breakfast Eatery. We waited for about 65 minutes for sunday morning brunch at 930. 

The food is kind of interesting. We ordered the pan fried oatmeal which was a little bit heavy on the allspice or clov. I couldn't quite pin down the airmatic but it was a little overwhelming with this dish.

My second dish was the fried chicken and French toast. The fried chicken was very good and the french toast was average. 

Honestly my favorite thing at this place was the green relish tasting hot sauce that they have on the table. It reminded me of a spicy pear relish my grandma use to make in Mississippi.

I would say it's good to try if there is no line other than that I would look for breakfast elsewhere in the area."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place was on my must try list for a long long time and I hadn't had luck because there's always a long line waiting outside. I finally got lucky today and found there was only two girls waiting in the line when we walked pass at 2pm. We joined them and the line quickly formed after us. Anyway, it took less than 10min for the two of us to get in and we already knew what to order:
Charlie's bowl - one of their signature item. Actual bowl looks bigger than how it looks like in the photo. A lot of stuffs and really yummy. You can get scrabble egg instead of sunny side up.
Chicken and waffle - juicy and crispy. I added maple syrup to get best taste out of it.
Brioche French toast - it's my favorite item. I ordered it for dessert after reading another Elite's review (thanks Mandy!). Peach, bacon and French toast, who think they'll blend with each other so well?!
Service is awesome. Our attendant always approach us with a big smile on her face which really lighted up the whole dining experience.
I want go back to try the pan cake next time, if I can get lucky again to avoid the crowd :p"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long wait, but worth it. Great breakfast, amazing service and the very best mimosa I've ever had. I'll go back when I have time for the lineup. 
I had one of the eggs benny gluten free style. It was delicious! I had the classic ham and the Jammer mimosa. 
I would have both items again. I highly recommend!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really enjoyed Jam Cafe.  It was cute, the waitress was super engaging, the food was good. My favorite added touch was the blankets at each seating spot, which made you feel like home. 

I just don't know if I would wait in the 1 1/2 hour line again.  We know they have opened up two additional restaurants in the area to help with the wait time.  Hopefully their success continues. 

It was a fun experience."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I got the Later Tater bowl and my husband had the Cinnamon Apple French Toast with a side of fried chicken.   The food was delicious!

EVERYTHING on the menu looked incredible. The service was excellent and the ambience was also very nice."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"An hour wait at noon, even on a weekday, be prepared. Is it worth it? Maybe if it was 1/2 hr instead of 1hr so best to avoid peak lunch hour... And with good company to keep me entertained in the line-up since they don't take your number here and call you to come back like some other places. 

So after waiting an hr, I was not about to order a benedict that I could get at any brunch place; I wanted something different. My friend recommended the Charlie Bowl to share. They only offer one size (they used to offer small/large options) and this was enough to feed 3+ ppl! It was delicious though and I would get it again. I had food coma after with the biscuit, gravy, hash, ham, bacon, corn, egg, etc all mixed together in one heavy bowl. Leftovers were had. We also had a side of pork belly which came in 2 large pieces which though tasty, was reminiscent of roast pork I would get at the Chinese BBQ joints...

They also have plenty of tempting dessert dishes and I had to try one; we went with the Cracker Jack. Banana, chocolate, in brioche bread - tasty, huge portion, but not memorable. I would try a different dessert next time.

Service was friendly and not rushed. I'll be back when I have good company to wait with again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Love everything about this place. The line was really long- they said it would be about a 45 min wait for a 4 people table but it actually only took 25-30 min. The food and service were great! I would say if you aren't that hungry, share a plate because the servings are kind of big. You must try the Jam Iced Coffee! It's pretty similar to Vietnamese coffee which is amazing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I love breakfast, most importantly i love eggs Benedict. Jam cafe delivers on both taste and service. We were visiting in Vancouver and this place was recommended as one to try. We ended up going a second time as it is that good. Thank you to Rina for your recommendations."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This places lives upto the hype and is worth every minute you have to wait for it. I was in vancouver for 3 days and got breakfast at Jam for two days because it has soo many options. My absolute favorite was the grilled grapefruit. I got it two days in a row and now make it at home for people who visit. I even got the green eggs and avocado (no ham for this vegetarian!), post that pesto scrambled eggs are my favorite. The red velvet pancake is huge and comes wjth a cream cheese icing/syrup but is a good shareable side. The next day I got the veggie bowl which was as good as the food one the first day. Mushroom gravy was to die for and I wish I had gotten a side of it on the first day. Overall a must visit place!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I was deciding between Medina and Jam and I decided to go with Jam upon the recommendation of my Vancouver foodie tour guide! 

We came on a Saturday morning - arrived at 7:30am to wait in line. We were the 4th party to get seated. The 30 minute wait wasn't too bad. Just maybe bring an umbrella if you plan on waiting because there isn't really a covered area if it does start raining (Yes, SoCal girl here with a fear of water droplets). 

We got the Charlie Bowl and split it between us. We also had FOMO so we ordered a side of fried chicken and a side of fried pork belly. The Charlie Bowl was awesome!!! Since it had everything in it, it felt like we tried a little of everything (egg, ham, biscuit, cheese, gravy and gosh I can't remember what else but it was delicious). My most favorite was the fried chicken!! Omg you have to get it. Perfectly seasoned, crispy, tasty, thin slice of chicken. So good!! I thought the pork belly was ok. It was good but it wasn't anything too special. Between the two of this, this was more than enough food. We managed to finish 98% of it because my husband ate my portion. LOL. 

Service was very friendly and fast. When we left around 8:40, the line was super long. Come at least before 7:30 so you're not waiting around for people to finish eating! 

Enjoy!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Really disappointed by this spot! 
Huge line and had to wait for a while to get in. 
The menu has ton of options so we tried a couple of items. 
The coffee was really average. 
But the food was overall very disappointing. 
First portions are huge! Order the fries and you get a salad bowl of fries!!! I like when portions are generous but here it's a waste... the waitress didn't warn us that portions were that big! 
Biscuits were not good, fried chicken was pretty dry, gravy was super salty and not ""saucy"" enough. The eggs Benedict were ok. Not bad but had way better. 
And the most disappointing was the French toast. Super dry white bread. It's not a brioche at all!!! And cut so thick!!! It's not a good thing if you don't use good brioche! 
Really don't understand what the good reviews are about and why this place keeps having such a big line. Way better options for breakfast in Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Carb-loading? Cheat day? CHECK OUT JAM CAFE!! It's my third time at Jam Cafe and it's worth the long wait! If you go right when they open the line usually isnt that long (25-30 minutes). My boyfriend ordered the Charlie Bowl and I ordered the veggie bowl with a side of maple candied bacon. It was delicious (and heavy, literally). I finished about a third of my bowl and packed the rest to-go. I also tried the Farmer's Breakfast skillet, it was good but I'll probably go with the veggie bowl again or try the naan breakfast burrito!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Luckily when we came here Monday morning at 10, there was no line. Really big portions, good dishes to share. I had gravy coops with chicken and sausage gravy, Caesar, grapefruit brûlée. My friends got iced coffee and chicken French toast and the other tater tot bowl
I found both my friend's dishes a bit sweet. My dish was good but nothing special. I loved the grapefruit brûlée. 
Maybe my expectations were too high but I just didn't enjoy my brunch as much as I thought I would. I wouldn't mind coming again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It was worth the wait in the misty rain.  The atmosphere was warm and pleasant and we had an excellent waitress ""Nancy"".  It is a most to come visit.  We had a wonderful meal!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yesterday I got to go to Jam Cafe on Beatty for breakfast.  I used a recommendation from a friend and truly loved this place and it was a wonderful treat to go to this local place and try everything from this place and the menu.  

I went to the location around 8:30 am and the place opened at 8 and their was already a line around the block for this place.  I was by myself and was able to sit at the bar right away.  I got a great seat and was able to talk with the waitress and get the insights about this place.  I decided to take a few friends recommendations who have been here and got the Charlie Bowl.  First can I say that the size of this dish was huge!  I was not able to finish my meal at this place. 

The Charlie Bowl on the bottom had some homemade biscuits on it, some gravy, potatoes, ham, peas, bacon, corn salsa, cheese, and two eggs sunny side up.  I mixed the eggs together and it was awesome to taste it all.  I did not like the green onions, but I can see why people love it.  You get so much food, I can tell you share with a friend.  

The inside of this restaurant is not huge, but it is really nice inside.  They have lots of really cool antiques and stuff on the wall.  They do not have a ton of space, but they stuff you into this place.  

I really enjoyed everything about this place and it was really really good.  If I find myself back in Vancouver, BC I will for sure be back to try more menu items!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is outstanding! Delicious breakfast and lunches for a VERY reasonable price. We went for a late breakfast during the week, around 11:30am, and there was a short wait for a table. Definitely worth the wait. Yummy scrambled eggs and probably the best bacon I've ever tasted. And if you're into raspberry jam, well, theirs will bring you to your knees! Folks sitting one table over had pancakes that made my mouth water! Others we spoke with while waiting went on and on about how good the food is too. Portions are HUMONGOUS. Great coffee, terrific service, wonderful food. If you're in downtown Vancouver, don't miss this place - seriously, it's a keeper."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of my favourite breakfast and brunch places.  Delicious, generous portions. Have enjoyed everything I've ever eaten here.  Only drawback is the queue to get in that starts at least 30 mins before it opens at 8am until just before closing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Does it live up to the hype? I think so!

Wanted to come here on my weekend getaway to Vancouver. I came here on a Saturday morning between 10-11am and the line was down the street. You can't put your name in and walk away - you unfortunately have to wait outside. I waited for about 30 minutes and realized it was still probably going to be another hour or more. The inside of the restaurant is small and they fit as many tables inside as they could.

Decided to go eat somewhere else that day and try again on Sunday morning. I came right when it opened and I was the first person in line outside (8am). I would say to come 15 minutes early before the place opens and you will get seated (at least on a Sunday). 

I ordered a caramel latte, and then shared two entrees with my boyfriend. We picked the Charlie Bowl and the Chicken French Toast. The Charlie Bowl was so amazing - it literally tasted like thanksgiving stuffing it was so yummy. It has nearly every breakfast ingredient in it - all the goods. The Chicken French Toast was something so different than anything I've ever had before. The chicken and French toast was delicious and the tobasco honey sauce was so different it added a kick of flavor. 

Everything looked great that people around us were ordering but I would definitely make sure the Charlie Bowl is one of your choices. Also keep in mind that this is HUGE and easily feeds two people. We had to take half of it home with us."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great selection of unique creations. Staff a pleasure to deal with. Wait times are not ideal. Best breakfast joint in town.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I was honestly upset for waiting over an hour to be seated, having a few group of people go before our party of four. Seating arrangements -1, however that didn't stop me from giving this place a 5 Star because the food is superior and delicious!
From the decor to the different food options,this place honestly deserves the hype.
They are definitely cooking up some
Delicious food in there, trust me!
Taste buds will not be disappointed.
1. Buffalo Blue Fried Chicken - the blue cheese bc we don't like blue cheese. Best egg Benedict recipe ever! Finger licking good. This is the type of breakfast you never forget about. This plate is bringing us back to Vancouver. Yes, it is that good!
2.The Cracker Jack French Toast- best French toast/sweet breakfast ever! Portion is perfect to share. Shared it with the hubby.
3. Triple stack pancakes- cinnamon cream cheese. Yummmo! 
4. Kids silver dollar pancakes- Kid approved"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious and worth the 30+ minute wait!! I cannot say enough good things about this food. The staff is friendly despite being busy for hours. They have daily specials and each meal comes with a gooseberry which was a new fruit to me.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've come here twice now and this place never lets me down, I'm always surprised by something. 

Want no wait time? Start lining up at 7:45, 15 minutes before they open to be guaranteed a spot. It can get cold if you sit by the door, so ask for a table in the back or bring a sweatshirt. The staff is aware, so they have customers enter in the front and leave through the back to keep it warm, which I appreciate.

Good luck figuring out what you want to eat, because the menu is jam packed with unique and delicious items from sweet to savory, that will make it incredibly hard to make a decision. Portion sizes are huge and everything has been delicious. Their morning drink menu is extensive. Prices are very reasonable, considering how much food they give you and staff is friendly and attentive. 

My favorite is the sausage corndog thing that they have, I can't remember what it is listed as on the menu. It is super good and has been my favorite. This time I got the pork cheeseburger with sweet potato fries, which was delicious and last time I got the Charlie bowl which I couldn't come close to finishing. 

Come hungry, leave thinking you can't eat for the rest of the day!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Started off with the lonely piggy and that was tasty. It's their sausage dipped in pancake batter. They serve it with they maple syrup which was a nice sweet and salty combo. The strawberry lemonade was the best one I have ever had. strawberry purée tasted so fresh with the lemonade. Old town breakfast was simple which was what I was looking for. Must must try the jam! Absolutely delicious
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you haven't read it already...be prepared to wait 

But, highly recommend Jam for the quality of food, friendly staff and decor. I got in the line on a Saturday about 35 mins before opening and was 8th in line. The day before I got to Jam 10 mins after opening and the wait was 45 mins to get the next sitting. 
Both the waitress and guy next to me recommended the Charlie Bowl which is said to include most items on the menu. Holy food! Legitimately the only items missing are pancakes, French toast and hollandaise sauce haha. The entire bowl was delicious and seemed to be never ending with  likely around 2lbs. of food. The chopped up biscuit was crispy, flaky with a crispy shell which gave contrast to the softer hash browns on the bottom...yes there is a bottom apparently. I almost found the bottom. The best item in the bowl is the ham. Smoked and diced into thick pieces, I tried to eat each piece individually. 
The two sunny side eggs on top add a little sauce if you don't try their jalapeño hot sauce (4/10 spicy). Also ordered an OJ which was mildly pulpy and fresh for coming from a gallon jug. 
If I were to come back I'd try either French toast or a Benedict dish. Lots of those being ordered around me
Overall rating: 9.3/10"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam is overrated. They need to have a reservation system or a come/put your name down/walk around type of wait. 

This waiting in a line outside their building is stupid AF and not worth it. The line creates the hype and psychologically makes people think it's something spectacular when it's decent. 

Large portions. Good caesars. The Charlie bowl is brilliant."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"First timer! We showed up around 11am. I hear this place always has a line, luckily we didn't have to wait in the cold for long! The staff is quick and friendly. I ordered the chicken & waffles. SO DELICIOUS! The gravy was phenomenal. Even though it was chicken breast, it was so moist and had the perfect crust. Same goes for the waffle, so fluffy, crisp and soft. It came with 2 runny eggs on top. I was very satisfied. The dish is huge- I had only eaten my chicken and one waffle and was stuffed. You could share this plate! Prices are very reasonable as well. Def will be back in the area!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of my favourite breakfast spots in town! Their biscuits are to die for and the option to have bailey's in your brunch coffee is never a bad thing. Suitable for a variety if occasions as well - I've been there for hungover breakfast with my friends as well as lunch with my grandparents. Very good food, but that sometimes comes with longer wait times. Not much that Jam can do about this, just make sure to plan accordingly when coming here!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ugh soo good! I am a sucker for a good breakfast and this place hits the spot. My boyfriend and I ended up going here three days out of the five days we stayed because it was THAT GOOD. 
There is usually a line 20-30min tops. Since it was the two of us, we usually got to cut the line because a lot people had a party of three or more.
I ended up getting three different plates, the three times we went here, and all dishes were BOMB!
10/10 would recommend!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"THE most filling brunch I've ever had! We arrived around 9am on a Monday and waited about an hour and 15 minutes in line before we got seated. The restaurant itself is quite small but very cozy with rustic-style decor.

I ordered The Charlie Bowl, which surprisingly, is A LOT bigger than it looks in photos! I didn't expect their portions to be so big but it's a good size for sharing. My boyfriend ordered The Gravy Coops with fried chicken and a side of fried pork belly. I didn't get the chance to try this because I was so stuffed from the Charlie Bowl but he said it was really good as well. The pork belly was fried perfectly on the outside and tender on the inside. Additionally, we got one red velvet pancake and it was SO yummy. I love red velvet cupcakes and this was essentially a less-sweet red velvet cupcake in pancake form - drizzled with sauce (might've been cream cheese sauce?). It was moist, delicious, and also huge. Probably one of the best pancakes I've ever had. I also ordered the Classic Jam Bacon Caesar and it was delishhh! Spicy, and comes with a slice of lime, bacon, and pickled asparagus. Perfect breakfast pairing! 

Overall, I think Jam Cafe is definitely worth the wait. The food was delicious, SUPER filling, and servers are friendly. Fantastic brunch spot!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"WARNING: if you don't like good food, don't come here. 

Easily one of the best brunch places I've been to!

Stumbled upon this gem during our visit to Vancouver. 

The food was definitely worth the wait. They have a daily specials menu. I'm so glad the bacon poutine Benedict was available the day I went. I had one of the most memorable foodgasms ever. 

If you're ever in the area, definitely check this place out. If you're never in the area, do yourself a favor, buy a ticket to Vancouver and go try this place!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cool vibe, great food, and diverse adult beverages. There is a little bar in the back where you can watch  an assortment of coffee drinks being made. There are a bunch of small tables that can be pushed together to accommodate groups. I ordered the Smashed Avocado Benny and it was on point. It even came with a kiwi slice as garnish, not an orange or melon (which no one really ever wants)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Oh, Jam Cafe. Ever since I tried the one in Victoria several years ago, it's been my go-to brunch spot despite the long lineups. For this visit, we went on a Saturday at 1pm and had to wait for about 50 minutes before being seated.

TASTE: Having ordered the Charlie Bowl nearly every time I've gone to Jam Cafe, I decided to try the Gravy Coops ($17) this time. It was delicious and beautifully presented. The sunny-side up eggs were perfectly cooked, with the deep orange yolks oozing out as soon as I cut into them. The outside of the fried chicken was crunchy and well-seasoned, while the inside was juicy and tender. The buttermilk biscuit was not too dense and, along with the sausage gravy, perfectly complemented the rest of the dish. The hash browns were a nice addition as well. If you want some heat, you should add the housemade tomatillo sauce - it's not too spicy and adds just the right amount of kick to each bite. 

My friend ordered the Cast Iron Macaroni ($16) and a double of The Jammer mimosa ($12). Both of us agreed that the macaroni was alright (especially in comparison to my dish), but we both enjoyed the candied bacon on top.

VALUE: For a brunch spot, I would say that Jam Cafe is a pretty good value. The portions are huge and, depending on how rich the dish is, may even need to be packed up afterwards. The drinks, however, are not as worthwhile as the food, but are on par value-wise with other restaurants.

SERVICE: We waited for 20 to 30 more minutes for our food to arrive. Though this was longer than I would have liked, the quality of the food more than compensated for it. Our waitress was also friendly and attentive. She checked up on us to ensure we were enjoying the food and was generally on top of water refills. At no point did we feel rushed in eating. 

AMBIANCE: It's a cozy space with incredibly interesting decor. Despite it being a full house, it didn't feel like we were packed like sardines and the noise level was manageable too. 

Overall, I had yet another great experience at Jam Cafe; I highly recommend this place! If you want to avoid the lineup, I'd suggest going at either 7:45am or after 2:30pm."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow wow wow! Finally got to try the famous Jam Cafe ! I am super glad they opened this second location! We only had a 10 minute wait instead of the customary 2 hour long Sunday brunch line wait.  The food just blew us away ! I have been so disappointed with the hot breakfast spots in Vancouver like red wagon, Sophie's etc.   We started with maple sausages dipped in pancake batter and fried and served with maple butter .   I got ""The Gravy Coops"" buttermilk fried chicken,  Served on a buttermilk biscuit topped with two sunny eggs, green onions, peas, sausage gravy. Served with hash browns. 

Chellisa got the ""Naan Breakfast Burrito"" - 
Indian Naan bread, two sunny side eggs, avocado-bean salad, goat cheese and our house chili sauce.  

Everything was great and so many more things on the menu I want to try out !!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Worth the wait ! Unless you come in at 7:30 am in the morning be ready to wait in line for 45 minutes but the food was worth the wait. The cappuccino was smooth and creamy and liked my veggie bowl. Although I do wish there were more veggies and less of the biscuit but liked the mushroom gravy. Liked the decor and the presentation of the food as well.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ok, that wait was worth it. Those were the fluffiest eggs that I've ever had. And the cinnamon roll pancake? Divine. Melted in my mouth. If you're in Vancouver and have some time to spare for an incredible brunch, then look no farther."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I wouldn't say this breakfast spot is out of this world, as the reviews and pictures suggest. Then again, I have very high standards for breakfast :) I ordered the skillet and the bast part was the sourdough toast with cranberries (so amazing!). The eggs were super buttery though and the bacon was almost all fatty pieces that seemed undercooked to me. 

Coffee was good, atmosphere is lovely, service is excellent. So if you dont have to wait in line, I'd suggest giving it a try for their biscuits -  really good! But their eggs and bacon - no thank you!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here for my birthday brunch the line up was real! We didn't have reservations and waited about 45mins in the cold...

Lots of parking available as there's a lot across the street

Restaurant was small, good for small groups. I felt ""jam"" packed and confined to my small table area. 

Menu is extensive
My chicken & waffles were delicious. Portions are good. Really enjoyed the beverages too
I can see why people line up for brunch here

I would def encourage people to check it out. Food is great! Considering how busy the restaurant is, service is pretty good as well"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My meal was ""meh"" but my other dining partners liked theirs. They had a couple of Benedict options. I went for the pan fried oatmeal but it was soooo mushy, inside and out. It was covered with a sauce. Not great. I loved the decor. The wait time was about 45 minutes on a Sunday at 9 and you need to have everyone in the party to be seated. I would recommend going if it's just two people. And don't order the oatmeal. ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam cafe is doing something right. We came at 9am the first day and the like was halfway through the block with a packed dining room. We didn't want to wait so we came back at 7:40am the next day (20 minutes before opening) and were still at least in 10th position. We got in right away but the first group that didn't get in waited at least 45 minutes. Dang! we got a scramble and the special coconut banana waffles. It tasted good and we were glad we came back for it, but I am not sure it is worth that much wait, we had the same food at other places with not quite the wait, good for them though!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Started at the end,
Now I'm here!

Arrived in line at 11:45am. At the entrance of Major Tom.  Tip: Park at Costco parking lot $2/hour. That's going to be your line up parking fee right there. Or, park at Tinseltown to buy your Starbucks and get free parking there. Then you have something to sip on as you wait. As the last person standing in line, I can see the people lining up behind be give up and go somewhere else.

Yeah! We got in! It was a 2 hour wait.  We got in roughly at 1:45 to be seated.  Not that bad. It is a smallish restaurant focused on service and comfort.  [Jumping Ahead: I noticed when I was seated, there was a table of 4 beside me, they paid and were just sitting there chatting. There was a group of 6 people waiting for their table.  The servers didn't rush the group of 4 beside me to leave.  This was great!  Eventually, one of the guys that was waiting for their table became irritated, he went inside to ask the group of 4 to leave so they could be seated and eat]. 

The food was nicely prepared.  Nothing was over or undercooked.  It was kind of cold when it came out but that is understandable, they were waiting for a few things to finish at once to bring the food out together.  The portion size was moderate, it's not overwhelming, and it wasn't small enough that you couldn't share (*Medina portion size is small and can't be shared, which is a similar restaurant).  I would skip fries as a side and order something else.  

Ambience is great, real chill Sunday kind of vibe.  This is definitely one of those Vancouver travel spots that people have to gram.  If you're looking to have a nicely prepared meal then this would be a place to go.  In terms of price wise.  It's worth it.  A $20 per person meal, this would be cheaper than paying for an included hotel breakfast.

Ingredients are fresh, the cooking isn't complicated, yes you could probably make everything at home.  But why would you when you're hung over from the night before from partying in Downtown.  You should come here with 3-4 people so you can try more things.  If you're here with just two people, 2 dishes are enough."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"That line is no joke! My friend and I waited at least an hour to get in on a Saturday, but the food was delicious as expected. Their menu options made it really difficult to choose. I ended up getting their Charlie Bowl, which might be the heaviest thing I've ever ordered. This isn't a bad thing though! I had it over 3 morning meals. It consisted of eggs, biscuits, sausage gravy, hash browns, cheddar cheese, ham, and bacon. My friend had a delicious Benedict, which I will definitely be trying next time. 

The alcoholic drinks are also delicious FYI. 

It was cold on this December day, which they accommodated for with comfy blankets. Our server was really nice too."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Always a super long long long line up. But worth it. Been coming here a few times for weekend brunch with friends n have been great. They don't rush you out the door like some other busy brunch places. Really love this brunch place.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow, definitely a must go when visiting Vancouver! The wait was only about 20 min but it was definitely worth it. I had the Old Town breakfast and it was so yummy!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been to this place 3 times in the last week. Hoping that the service would get better. But every server in Jam Cafe is absolutely miserable. My waitress didn't even look at me. And pretty much threw the plate of food down on the table. The food is decent. But the service in here is terrible. And this was multiple servers. Not just the one. I understand everyone has bad days, but each time I went here. It's been the same vibe. Safe to say I'd never come here again. Medina Cafè is way better. And has better vibes!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This cafe is definitely jammin' with a line down the sidewalk even in close to freezing temperatures. My family and I decided to try out Jam Cafe when we found that it was open for Christmas weekend (and every holiday, apparently!) 

I recommend going before it opens because even at 10AM, which is still early for my standards, we had an hour wait to be seated. The restaurant itself is very cozy and seems better suited for smaller parties of two or less. 

Jam Cafe has a pretty extensive breakfast menu that is served all day. We decided to try the:
- Chicken & Waffles - Definitely a heavier breakfast with fried chicken on top of a stack of golden belgian waffle pieces covered in gravy and sunny side eggs. If you're like my mom and don't like soggy waffles, ask for the gravy on the side. 

- Chicken French Toast - Now here's a twist to the chicken and waffle dish! Think fried chicken on top of thick brioche french toast - YUM. I especially loved the combination of the pickled cabbage, BBQ glaze and honey hot sauce which helped the dish from tasting too cloyingly sweet. Another heavier dish, I would definitely share this with someone the next time around.

I especially want to note the awesome service at this restaurant. Our server came back often to refill our coffees and see how we were doing. We had a reparking situation and the server offered to hold my dad's dish in the back after the rest of us had been served. Due to circumstances, we had to take the dish to go, but I appreciated that she kept checking to see when we wanted to bring the dish out and even sent us off with a to-go coffee, since my dad didn't have a chance to have it at the restaurant. 

I definitely want to check out Jam Cafe again in better weather when it's easier to wait outside. Prices are typical for a brunch spot, landing in the $15+ price range per dish. Be sure to check out their daily board for specials as well - as of yesterday, they were featuring an eggnog french toast and eggnog latte (with or without rum) - yum! :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Well worth the one hour wait in line! This place is very small, so be ready to wait in line. The food and service was amazing though. This was my first time here, but won't be my last time! Loved it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We went on a Saturday morning and was not aware of how long the line up was. Good food but line up is too long.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Looking for good brunch or comfort food jam has got you covered , the only downside was the wait . I knew there would be a line but since we had a party of 4  it took a little longer then expected. Once we were seated we didn't look back. I got to try the chicken and waffles which was taken to the next level with the sausage gravy and fresh eggs as well as the pulled pork pancakes. If you're in the area and have some time jam is def worth the visit"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"*belated review*
My husband and I waited 40 minutes on a Friday morning, in the rain and cold, to eat brunch at Jam Cafe in tight seating. Was it worth it? For the most part, yes!

Here's what we ordered and loved:
1. London Fog latte - the best ever!! I'm obsessed with earl grey flavor and this was totally my jam! Fun fact: did you know that this drink originated in Vancouver?
2. Pan-fried oatmeal skillet - so unique and worth trying once. The lemon curd and berry sauce complemented the oatmeal cakes wonderfully.
3. Fried chicken & French toast - creative twist to the more popular chicken & waffles dish, which I prefer because the French toast was on the dry side :( The fried chicken however was well-seasoned and delicious, especially with the hot honey drizzle. Warning: portion is huge/shareable.

Service was prompt, friendly, and never rushed, despite the never-ending line outside. I wouldn't mind returning during off peak time, if that exists."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ok food is good that's a duh, service was... slow waited over 30 minutes and nothing came to the point where I had to ask for it to be take out cause I had an appointment... 

ALSO... FUCK THE CUTLERY!! Cool I get it save the planet but it literally SNAPPED POKING EGGS!! #firstpoke WTF!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Finally tried jam cafe!!! We waited in line for 1 your even though it was a Thursday mid morning. The servers gave us the menu to look at while we were in line. The interior was super cute and aesthetic, but the highlight was definitely the food!! The portions were huge to begin with, and I was shook from just the first bite into it. The flavorful gravy cakes the biscuit, the cheese smothered the ham, corn, peas and bacon. All the goodness was bedded by a layer of hashbrown and toped by two eggs too. I was only able to finish half of it, and was super full already. Other than the long wait, I would love to come again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is one of my top 2 breakfast/ brunch places in the world; I won't be able to say which is better until we've been back to Barcelona a few more times. 9.8/10 (deductions for the wait outside, which has ranged from 40 minutes in the rain, to 2.5 hours).

Everything tastes fresh and deliciously decadent. It's breakfast fare, but elevated.

Their cinnamon swirl pancake is the best we've had anywhere. Get the single, not the triple stack, as only the top pancake receives frosting.

On days we can't afford nearly 2 hours of waiting in line and just grab IHOP or Dennys, we end up paying about the same, but additionally Jam's cuisine is cleaner (less greasy), fresher & more flavorful, with the added benefit of being so filling that we always end up with leftovers.

Recommended: Gravy Coops, eggs Benedict, pork belly Benedict, chicken & waffles, Cinnamon Swirl pancake, single pig (3 pigs is also a bit too filling). The strawberry lemonade is also refreshing; doesn't have that artificial ""candy"" flavour like at fast food joints

Avoid: nothing we've found so far. Except ready yourself for a long wait (typically 1hr 45) but the food comes quickly.

Ironically the other place I love, Citizen Café in Barcelona, you only wait 45 minutes to get seated, but then the food actually takes an hour to arrive anyway."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Man......jam cafe needs to come to Texas period!! My friends and I went to the location in  Victoria and the one in Vancouver. The food is so delicious and they give  u a lot!! The first time we went had the Charlie bowl with a pancake on the side and the second time we went I had the friend chicken Benny with a pancake on the side haha (I'm not fat but definitely  a foodie). My friends and I always get different items on the menu and share our food so we can taste as much of the food on the menu as possible and jam definitely did not disappoint.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great little find! Be prepared for a wait but its worth it. We had the buffalo chicken benny. The flavor pairings were incredible. There wasn't  an item on the menu I wouldn't  have tried. The portions are enormous so make sure your hungry or ready to share and don't forget the cocktails! The Cesar was spot on!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place has the best pancake I have ever eaten!!! Plus they let you order just 1 instead of a stack which is the perfect portion, even if you're sharing. The tater tot bowl was so amazing as well. The pulled pork and egg combo was perfection. I would give this place 5 star if I wasn't disappointed with the fried chicken eggs Benedict. The chicken was not crispy and the sauce did not taste like hollandaise. We got there when they opened their doors and there was a long wait which was surprising for a Thursday morning. It's definitely worth the wait though!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is a great little breakfast restaurant!!  

Expect to wait in line and then you won't be frustrated when you have to!  I never mind waiting in line for a restaurant because it just builds the excitement for how good it is going to be!  Silly I know but just the way that my mind works. I think that it is so smart of them to have the small cozy enviroment that they have! I think we waited for about 45 mins...down the block a little! Bring a snack for anyone that tends to get a little bit HANGRY when waiting too long!

The menu has some super fun breakfast items!  I think the candied bacon was the best item that we tried at our table!  The Eggs Benny was great as well.  I decided that I was going to be brave and get the Pulled Pork Pancakes...a litlle sweet and savoury dish!  It wasn't my favourite...but I am still glad that I tried it because I love trying new things!

Overall we really enjoyed this place and would recommend it!  Wait in the line...bring a coffee and a little snack...chat with the people you came with and enjoy the whole experience!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good food but the lineup is ridiculous. The wait time might be ok for a tourist but as locals my wife and I no longer eat at this restaurant. This restaurant has been open for years and still does not accept reservations, the least you could do is use Yelp waitlist like OEB does, which is now where we go for brunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I was on a solo trip for a couple days and saw this was a good place to go. I even waited in line for more than 30 minutes late on a Thursday morning. It did not disappoint!! The chicken and waffles were so delicious and my London Fog tea was perfect.

This is a repeater!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great ambiance. The decor is really good. 
We waited inline (on a Saturday) from 12:15-1:50. There is a copy of the menu in the window for you to peruse, once you're at the front of the line. 
Service was decent and the food was hit and miss. We actually ordered 5 dishes (yes, I was hungry and the menu was very appealing. :)
It wasn't the amazing experience that I expected it to be (after standing outside and in line for that long but oh well, it was an experience)
I'm in no rush to go back but if I may, I'd recommend the Turkey Lurkey sandwich :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"i try not to judge businesses based on expectations because it could be unfair to places with good reputations. but for a cafe with a 1+ hour long wait and retractable belt barriers around the queue (DAMN), i couldn't help but constantly question if things were living up to the hype.

breakdown:
+ classic mimosa w/ grapefruit juice ($12): refreshing and tasty!
+ fried chicken benedict ($16): crazy about the roasted corn salsa, awesome touch on a timeless dish. however the egg was not poached and the hashbrown was bland and hard.
+ brioche french toast w/ caramelized apples and cinnamon ($14.50): a nice sweet treat, glad we shared this one because it probably would've been too much for one person to handle.
+ farmer's breakfast skillet ($15): very ordinary, and i was pretty disappointed by the size. we opted for the cranberry toast, which i thought was the star of the show.

as for the service, it was a bit detached and surprisingly slow. makes me think that the line outside is a result of the slow turnover rate and not necessarily the food's goodness. i gotta hand it to the hosts and waiters for dealing with such a large volume of customers though, not to mention the kitchen which must be going bonkers. that said, something about the workflow has got to be reevaluated!

the verdict: it's good, but underwhelming. if you arrive early or are a brunch fiend then i say go for it, but not a do-or-die."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Read the reviews before coming here, and decided to make my own judgement. Yes the wait is long and let me tell you, it isn't worth it. We only waited in line for about 45 min compared to certain peoples 2 hour wait. But anyways the food was sub par. Barely any flavor (or just not good). Took a few bites of our $30 order of food(refunded 50% from manager after pretty much saying ""that if my girlfriend kept eating, he wouldn't refund us""(she literally took a nibble of toast after I asked) left disappointed. Super small place too, elbow to elbow with people you don't know. So if you feel like waiting really long for ALRIGHT food and sit in a crammed place, THIS IS FOR YOU. If the food was even decent, they could make up for everything else but sadly not."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good, but over-hyped. If I could give this 3.5 I would.
We arrived just before opening, but unfortunately missed the cut and had to wait 45 mins, which is fine and most great places require a wait time. Unfortunate that they have no phone or buzzer system, like most places that are used to longer wait times.

We had the banana walnut pancakes, granola parfait and coffees (beans from Drum roasters - Cobble Hill, BC). 

Coffee: was actually a little bitter and acidic, not great, but refills were plentiful. The way that the ""barista"" prepares even filter (drip) coffee has a huge effect on the profile of the coffee, so this is not necessarily any reflection of the roaster. 

Food: Good balance between granola and yoghurt with the fruit, was quite tasty, but granola could be more flavourful and varied. As for the pancakes, portion was HUGE. The bananas were tasty (they were glazed), but a bit too soggy for my liking. The pancakes themselves were quite good, but were rather plain and stodgy to be honest. Emma's Country Kitchen in Toronto, is still my favourite. Cinnamon and some whole wheat flour would for me make it that much better, as would mixing in ingredients to the batter. 

Service: It was good as far as attentiveness and pleasantness. However, absolutely felt rushed and pushed out for turnover. The bill was brought without asking, as was the question of ""do you need the card machine"" without me even having my wallet out or any indication I was ready to pay. I know there is a queue outside, but I guarantee that they are rushing not for the customers outside, but for the turnover $$$. We did just wait outside for 50 mins, so not cool...I was mid drinking my refill of coffee I asked for.  

I advise to go if there is no queue, otherwise it's really not worth it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Seems like a local favorite that we didn't want to miss while in Vancouver. The food was great but the wait here is really considerable. We came on a Monday and were surprised to see 20+ people in line outside. Someone said it may be about 15 minutes, so we were glad to stay and try it. 40 minutes later we had a table, and ordered right away. No allergies, no special requests and it was 25 minutes til the food came out. Meal was delicious but I don't know if anything in the breakfast realm is worth that wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"First off, let me say that an eggs benedict is not ever my dish of choice for breakfast. My friend who is a local recommended that I come here and try it, so I reluctantly agreed. 

I ordered the veggie benedict with hash browns, and it completely exceeded my expectations. I could probably eat this dish everyday. The hash browns were the best I've ever had as well. As a self-professed potato addict, I care more about how my potatoes taste than my eggs. The hash browns were cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The grilled tomato kind of seemed like a random addition initially, but it added that hint of acidic flavor which balanced out the dish perfectly. 

We also ordered the stuffed nutella and banana french toast, it was pretty good, but a little too rich for my palette.

I just wish they had a location in LA because I find myself thinking about their veggie benedict all the time."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam is tried and true to the reviews. 
Ultimately a fantastic spot for 2 or a party of 5. 
Kids are definitely welcomed (see picture for proof!)
The adventurer decor will catch the eye. Staff were kind enough to allow us to grab coffee as we wait. Not something they currently offer as I asked but maybe if they are reading this it catches on during the winter. We waited 35mins or so in line, not uncommon at 10am on a Saturday. The food was inventive, large portioned,and flavorful! No detail is left out and it's a well thought restaurant, event the washrooms.
Parking opportunities are not a concern in this review."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We took our place in line around 9:30 a.m. on Family Day and were told it would be a minimum 45-minute wait. Exactly 45 minutes later, we had the opportunity to sit at the bar (or to wait 10 more minutes for a table). We took the bar. My husband and I shared the cinnamon roll pancake, the Charlie bowl, and a ""lonely piggy"" -- all three were indulgently rich and pleasantly unique takes on standard diner fare. Certainly worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been meaning to stop by each Vancouver visit and something always comes up. Finally came by on a Wednesday morning, just before 9am.

There was no lineup but it was still fairly busy, we were seated immediately and staff was super helpful and friendly.

We ordered an iced coffee, London fog, fried chicken eggs benedict and the cinnamon swirl pancakes.

Everything was perfect, honestly, and you know I'm super picky. Ty vancity for always holding up the opinion I have of you.

The iced coffee was delicious and close to a Vietnamese style and sweetness. The London fog was great, just sweet enough with a lovely Earl Grey tea and no bitterness.

The fried chicken was thin and crisp, well seasoned, soft poached egg, tangy hollandaise and a fresh corn salsa. Pancakes were sweet but tangy enough to cut though the richness, you can tell they put some thought into balancing these dishes and they really shine!

We were sat near the front door and had a heater pointed directly at us that made it a tad uncomfortable on a rainy but still somewhat warm day, but the food was so good we couldn't be bothered.

100% must try."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow, I definitely could see why there is always long waits for this place. The food is amazing. I would say that the sugar-cured bacon was probably my favourite part of my meal. It tasted nothing like anything else I have ever tried. It was the BEST bacon I have ever tried. 

Highly recommend you guys try the sugar-cured bacon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There seems to always be a wait, but for us the line was about 30 minutes and it's worth the wait. We were in Vancouver for the weekend for an interview and was recommended this joint by a few friends. Their drinks are delicious (I liked the Caesar) and their food was good, I wish we tried a couple different things but that's for another visit! 

 Charlie Bowl: SO large, very filling, the flavours are pretty good I was putting lots of their homemade jalapeño sauce on this bad boy. The texture wasn't for me, as it was all one consistency in the bowl almost and came across a little mushy. But it was good and filling or if you want to share that's always a great way to try things. 
 
Pork belly Benny: the hollandaise sauce is amazing! The bennys are great I would recommend getting one. I didn't like pork belly as much, but I was seeing the chicken and avocado bennys come out and those looked drool-worthy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ok, so you know when you find a great place on yelp - highly reviewed and can't wait to review it yourself but your friends DIG into the food before you can take pictures?! This is what happened at Jam Cafe (sorry for the pictures). 

I'm going to give Jam the benefit of the doubt and just say we must have not ordered well, because as is, we would definitely not go back. This is not a typical breakfast joint. Don't expect to have normal flavors or normal things. 

Here's what we ordered: 

London Fog-  because when in Canada you probably need to have this. 5/5 

Chicken N' Waffles - 1/5. This was SO disappointing. Nothing was seasoned. It made us so sad. 

Pulled Pork Pancakes - 1/5. This was SUPER Weird. We were not expecting the flavors in this one and it was disappointing. There was cabbage on it and an oddly flavored sauce, think of asian/korean food mashed with American (very gummy) pancakes. We left most of this on the table. 

Side of Bacon - 2/5. Just not that impressive. 

We went with a lot of the things that were highly recommended and that the waitress recommended but this was just not our place. Wouldn't go back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is one of the rare instances where I completely missed the hype. We came around 11 on a weekday and walked away as the line was too far down the street. The next day, we returned at around 8:30am, were third in line, and waited for about 30 minutes. The interior is small but cozy and all the servers were very nice and helpful.

Per our waitress's recommendation, I tried the egg benedict with their famous fried chicken. The egg benedicts and the biscuit were standard. The chicken, however, was much too over-fried and dry, which... was a bummer. The potato hash was also just standard. I was underwhelmed to say the least. 

Friend tried huevo ranchero, which, again, was dry, which I didn't even think was possible.. The corn bread was dry (though to be fair I'm not the biggest fan of corn bread in the first place). The rest of the plate was pretty unremarkable. Perhaps we just missed the mark and got the wrong items? I'm not sure. I left feeling like I wasted our time in the city and the calorie.."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Incredible meal here! My party of 3 didn't wait at 10 am on a weekday, but a line formed outside shortly after we sat. I tried:

+ butternut squash gnocchi Benedict special, which was a hit with the eggs Benedict fans at the table
+ old town breakfast with cranberry toast, absolutely perfect
+ one (side) cinnamon roll pancake, probably my favorite thing that we ate
+ brioche French toast, this was a close second to the pancake. THOSE CARAMELIZED APPLES. 

Great prices and service was pretty good. Definitely one of the best brunch spots in town!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Another place that I think gets a little too overhyped. You'll usually find a line up outside. Tourists always come here too as a recommended brunch spot. I find their French toast and sweet dishes a lot more delicious than their savoury ones (ie egg Benedicts) 

Jam cafe is not bad. It's a decent meal but I don't think it's anything amazing. Definitely worth a try at least though but it's not my top pick for a place to eat at."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long, long wait. That part sucks. But the Harrison scramble and brioche French toast that my wife and I ordered was fantastic. My only critique is for the drip coffee, it didn't seem to match up to the food quality."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There is a wait. There is always a wait. Surrender to it. Bring a coat or a stool or an umbrella and just gab with friends or catch up in your favorite show or book because the one thing I know is that YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!

I've walked by this place before, judging and scoffing and well today...I scoff at the missed opportunities of my prior ignorance. 

This is a small joint with capacity at about 55 but the turnover is relatively reasonable. We had a party of four and waited about an hour from the farthest section of their partitions (you'll understand when you see it). 

My friends ordered the Casar which is Bloody Mary made with Clamato Juice garnished with a marinated asparagus and a crispy bacon strip. They ordered the veggie bowl and we got the Charlie Bowl, the pancake stake with cinnamon and cream cheese swirl. I was also curious about their version of pigs in a blanket (sausage dipped in pancake batter and deep fried) so I order the Lonely Piggy (1 stick) and also one piece of their famous fried chicken breast. Coffee and fresh OJ rounded out the order. 

Everything came out perfect and fresh and hot - pancake was crispy and chewy in all the right places, the Charlie Bowl was mostly like a deconstructed pot pie and quite tasty. The fried chicken was seasoned perfectly but please ask for a side of mushroom gravy to smother...your welcome!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"TLDR: worth the wait!
____

This meal was the start to a pretty awesome day. After this massive meal we went for an incredible bike ride on the sea wall.

Charlie bowl - massive serving. I mixed up all the goodies, for a delicious concoction. In it: Crumbled biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, corn salsa, peas, green onions, cheddar cheese and sausage gravy with two sunny eggs. Yeah, it's a hearty dish. 


Chicken and waffles - really good as well. Just had a bite of these.

Cinnamon swirl pancake - had a crispy top to it. This was the first thing we had and blmindblown. So good. Hate to start with sweets... yeah right, who am I kidding.)


Buttermilk biscuit - maple butter and jam - Wowowowow the butter was crazy and the jam so delicious.


Ceaser - amazing. This is a Bloody Mary with Clamato juice. Sounds disgusting but it's so delicious. I had a ton of these while in Vancouver. 

Side of bacon. Thick cut. Delicious

Amazing server - Diane - so nice and great service.

Waited 45 min in line and so worth it.
One of The best brunches I've ever had. You can say this place is...my jam. Har har har"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Very, very good! Got a Dutch baby, eggs sunny side up, and the 90's mimosa. The perfect start to the day and definitely worth the wait. 10/10"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I arrived at about 11am on a Tuesday and there was already a long line to get in. Overall the wait was about 40 minutes. 

Once seated I decided to order the Jam iced coffee and the Charlie bowl, which so many people recommend. The iced coffee is great! They give you a big glass and it has a good amount of flavour and sweetness. The Charlie bowl is a lot of food so I thought $16 was a great deal. I finished about half and took the rest home. It is a heavy carb dish so I wouldn't recommend if you don't like biscuits. I wish there was a bit more gravy because it can get dry near the bottom but overall I enjoyed it.

My friend ordered the Blackstone Benny which looked great as well! They have quite a few egg benny choices including ham, bacon and pork belly.

Not much to say about service but they do rush you a bit. We were asked if we were done while we still had food in our plates and given the bill before we finished our iced coffee. We had been seated less than an hour. It is understandable though since there was still a long line outside when we left. So this is a place to enjoy great food, but if you are expecting to sit leisurely and chat, I would go elsewhere."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came on a Saturday morning at 10:30am and the line was 90 minutes for two. The place is very cute inside and the service is notably good. The servers were very friendly and checked up on us frequently. 
Dishes are about $16 each and extremely filling. We got the Charlie bowl and the Porchetta Benny. The benny was finished but i only got through half of the Charlie bowl so the value is amazing.
In terms of taste the porchetta benny was perfect and highly recommended. The egg muffin was toasted perfectly, the porchetta was tender and seasoned well and the combination with pickled onions, arugula and hollandaise was absolutely fantastic. There was really good balance in the dish. 
The Charlie bowl was a bit too heavy for me and the concept just didn't work. There were too many elements going on at once to enjoy the dish. It was also a bit dry and the sausage gravy wasn't enough to save it. 

Cons
- Long lines

Pros
- Amazing service
- Good value
- Incredible benny

Service- 5/5+
Price/value- 5/5
Atmosphere- 4/5
Cleanliness- 5/5
Food- 4/5

Would i return? Yes, but i would try a benny instead"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best breakfast spot ever hands down!  Wife and O went to Jam Cafe bright and early to beat the rush.  Charlie's Bowl w a side Pork Belly and Avocado is a great combo!  Chicken and French Toast was surprisingly a interesting combo that we enjoyed!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There's always (used) to be a line up and I never understood why. I guess their portions are massive and it's comfort breakfast food. Can't go wrong. 
Pros:
- one meal meant for three 
- free coffee refills
- red velvet pancakes 

Cons:
- line upppoo
- line up
- line up"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Cute place! Staff was all extremely friendly. You get lots of food and it was good. Lots of options for breakfast foods and drinks too.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam is probably the hottest breakfast ticket in town.  On a Friday, non-holiday, morning, at 8am not everyone waiting could initially be seated (and it isn't small).

The decor and service are stellar, they have it dialed.  I've never seen a seating regime like this: military is what comes to mind and as an Operations minded person, I was impressed.  The doors opened and they filled the seats in no time (can someone here please help the airlines?!).  Only in Portland have I seen this level of chic and efficiency while still retaining the relaxed feel.  Prices are not cheap, but not out of line for the top sought after seats for breakfast/lunch ($15-17).

The creation are innovative and different but I hate to say it... I foundnd neither my sweet or salt tooth were satisfied.  Most people LOVED their meals but I felt the flavour combinations only mediocre but I honestly felt I may have ordered wrong.  The other reason I cannot give this place a 5 is they put peas in a number of the sauces for savoury breakfast dishes. Wtf is with that?! So wrong and disgusting.

Again, go here,.. but I actually go against my normal and say avoid the fried chicken dishes and anything with BBQ sauce and stick with the more ""normal"" dishes which they seem to hit out of the park."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is amazing! Unless you get there early, before it opens, you'll have to wait. Not a huge fan of waiting in line, bit this was definitely worth the wait. Fun chatting with other people in line while waiting. Both our breakfast meals were amazing. Definitely try this place when visiting Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"They definitely lived up to the hype! The reviews for Jam Cafe were amazing so I had to give it a try while visiting Vancouver. 

I went with my siblings. We started with the Ceasers which was a Bloody Mary variation. 

I got the Charlie Bowl which was a hodgepodge of breakfast favorites! It came in a large ramen bowl and was SO GOOD! It was a mix of biscuits and gravy,  ham, and eggs. We also tried the traditional eggs benedict. 

The only downside is the wait and parking. We waited about 1.5 hours for a group of three. Outside on a slightly rainy day. Parking was metered with a 3 hour time limit. 

Definitely go if you have time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I honestly hate waiting for food. Usually look for alternative or come when it's less busy but my husband and I waited for 1.5 hours. 

I got the later tater bowl and it was really good. The buffalo sauce was a bit unnecessary. Buffalo sauce just made it salty. I wish they put more chimichuri sauce rather than the buffalo sauce. 

Not sure if it was the wait that made the food taste better but we really enjoyed our brunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"+++
- fried chicken was delicious
- gravy, maple syrup, waffle were all the perfect complement to each other

++
- all the alcoholic drinks were on point, although the Jammer mimosa was more on the juicy side

+
- hashbrowns were good

TIPS:

- They told me 1.5 hours wait, it was 50 minutes (on a random Thursday morning)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Nice breakfast. The downside is the wait time. Spent 1.5 hrs in lineup and it's a bit pricey
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Oh my god.
I thought I've eaten it all as London has great brunch spots, but this was amazing. At the very least it is now in my top 3 GLOBAL favourite brunch places. 

Chicken French toast - delicious chicken, and well made French toast. The sauce it came with was incredible. I recommend this if you like thick French toast brioche style.

Buttermilk biscuit melt - if you like pastries the texture of scones, and like buttery things like shortbread, and like corn bread, try this. Buttermilk biscuits are awesome!

Portions are huge, and you could share one between two, but then since you've queued so long, you should treat yourself. Come with an empty stomach.

On the subject of queues... We arrived at 7:40am on a summer Sunday, was 22nd and 23rd in queue, and the place fits about 40-50. So we got a table easily in the first sitting at 8am."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Lined up at 10:45AM on a Saturday and got a table 1.25 hours later. Was it worth the wait? Nope, too bad (for us).

Service and decor are great but we expected an amazing brunch and we didn't get that.

Lonely Piggy ($4.50) was described as ""like a corn dog"" and what we got was the breakfast version of a corn dog. A pancake-like batter with a breakfast sausage inside. Sadly the batter wasn't crispy outside and would've fared better a bit longer in the fryer. The batter was undercooked throughout. 

The Charlie Bowl ($14.50) which lots of people rave about is a mish mash of ""crumbled biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, corn salsa, peas, green onions, cheddar cheese and sausage gravy with two sunny eggs."" Indeed it can probably feed a village and the first few bites you'll take will sit heavy in your stomach. Sunny side up eggs did not have runny yolks, there was a pool of gravy in the bottom and seemed like most of the bowl was the hash browns. Sure, the portion is gigantic but the mixture of flavours is nothing to write home about. Think this food shall remain in my GI system forever because there were no greens (except for the small bits of green onion?). Took the rest for leftovers but not sure if I want to eat anymore. 

Bf got the Harrison Salmon Scramble ($15) and also though it was average. He is the most unpicky eater but he didn't want to eat the salad because the dressing had a very sharp tart taste which was overwhelming."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came on a weekday afternoon and the line up was short, around 30 min. We ordered the red velvet pancake, the Charlie bowl, and the Gravy Coop. 

Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. 

Red Velvet Pancake - This was very disappointing. The pancake was super dense and chewy. It tasted like a cake or donut and not fluffy at all. 

The Charlie Bowl (biscuits, hashbrowns, ham, bacon, peas and corn salsa with a sausage gravy and two eggs) - This was a dish good for 2 people to share. The flavours were good, but it was too rich and heavy. I forgot to ask for gravy on the side and everything eventually turned into a mush. 

Gravy Coop (with pork belly) - This was a standard dish. The hashbrowns and eggs were good, but the fried pork belly was a little dry and had that slight stink pork belly sometimes have. 

Service is good! I've heard the line up can be over an hour long. Overall, not a bad place, but I wouldn't line up long for it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic food, great vibe: a Vancouver must go! I had the Charlie Bowl- deliciousness in a huge bowl. Hot gravy, biscuits, eggs and veggies... scrumptious! The brioche cinnamon apple French bread- best French bread we've ever had!

Cannot lose on this place!

Totally are JAM!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"DELICIOUS!!! Chicken and Waffles didn't disappoint me!! Better than I expected!!(: 
The Dutch baby was delicious. And the matchsticks fries were on point!!! I love it!!! The wait was worth it!!!!! 
Great service and lovely waitresses!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Wow! This place is amazing!! Best cinnamon pancake I've ever had!! I travel a lot and from the South and I've never had a pancake so tasty!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been dying to try this place after seeing the insane line ups and delicious pictures. Waited 40 minutes on a super rainy day and finally got seated at the bar. The service is great, everyone there is really friendly. 
They have a lot of options for brunch! I had a hard time selecting. I went for the chicken and waffle. The three piggies sounded so good so I ended up getting a lonely piggy. You can get half order of most the bennies which I thought was nice. 
I found the chicken and waffle okay. Nothing special. The portion is big. Good price. 
Honestly I don't think it's worth the line up. Good food but I wish you can leave your name and return instead of waiting outside."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My boyfriend and I are from Seattle and went to Vancouver for the weekend. We saw Jam Cafe on Yelp as one of their top rated brunch restaurants in the area so we really wanted to check it out. We came Saturday morning about one hour after it opened and saw a MASSIVE line of about 50+ people, and the host who was taking names said it was going to be an hour and a half wait. Since we were only there for the weekend, we didn't want to take up all of our morning by waiting and eating, so we decided to come back the next day. We woke especially early and got to the restaurant right when it opened, which is definitely a MUST. Like I said we were there right when it opened, and the restaurant was already 99% full. We got lucky and grabbed the last open booth right next to the window! The people who came in right after us ended up waiting 35+ minutes just to get seated. 
Food was absolutely delicious and quality. If I lived here, you bet that I would come frequently just to try everything on the menu. Customer service was also exceptional. We ordered their black coffee (great), the half portion of their bacon eggs Benedict (AMAZING), create your own omelette (fantastic 5/5), lemon curd Dutch baby (alright, too much lemon curd 3.5/5), and their grapefruit mimosa (great! 5/5). Wait time to get our food was decent but we mostly spent the time waiting taking pictures of everything around us. Honestly, I'd have to say that this is one of the best brunch places I've ever been to from Seattle to Vancouver. This is a brunch place I would DEFINITELY recommend, but you have to come right when it opens just to avoid the wait time. Food and service 5/5 but wait time is 2/5"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A breakfast / lunch place that is worth the wait!

If you can, be here a few minutes before they open (8am.)   It was the morning of the cruise and we were up at sunrise strolling around the area taking pictures.  It was fortunate because we were able to get in line about 10 minutes before 8...by the time 8am rolled around, there was enough people in line to fill every seat in the restaurant.  By the time we left at 845, there was an even longer line than there was at 8...this place is popular, and I can vouch that it's well deserved.

The menu is pretty overwhelming,  there are A LOT of really good sounding breakfast and lunch options which makes it really hard to choose.  Both bfast and lunch are served all day.

The two of us decided to get one savory dish and one sweet dish and we'd split them.  We got the Charlie Bowl and the Stuffed french toast.

First up, the Charlie bowl.   Ok, this thing is in the ""Man vs. Food"" category.  Seriously, this is so much food, it could easily make 3 meals...even for a bottomless pit like me.  It's crumbled biscuit, hash browns, diced ham, green onions, and cheddar cheese topped with sausage gravy and two sunny side up eggs.  This would be the perfect dish to carbo-load before a marathon.  The best part of all,  it was super tasty.  One thing to consider, they also have a mini Charlie bowl that's about 1/2 of the regular bowl, but for $3 more, I'd still get the regular and take home the leftovers.

Next, the ""Cracker Jack"".  This is their french toast stuffed with banana and nutella.  This was no joke either.  It comes with 2 thick sliced pieces of brioche, each slice is probably over an inch thick.  There's a good amount of bananas and nutella in there which makes this really filling.  It also came with a bowl of fresh fruit on the side and a hefty amount of whipped cream on top.

Some side notes...
They have pretty good coffee and a house-made hot sauce (I think tomatillo and jalapeno based) that's really delicious.
The food is also reasonably prices, esp considering the amount of food they give and the quality of it.

Hope to be back, really want to try some of their benedicts."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is ""the"" place for brunch in Vancouver - the super long line ups that never die down is proof.
The ambiance is really interesting, with eclectic memorabilia on the wall.  They even have an outboard motor as decoration!  I like it and it sure makes for good conversation with dining partners.
Service is super friendly.  They will provide complimentary waffles to those in line. Nice!  The maitre d' is helpful and fair with the seating.  Waiting staff is awesome, attentive.  They seem to really care.
The food is also very good.  I had the eggs Benedict with pork belly - eggs done to medium. Others ordered the eggs Benedicts daily special (Lambs), it is much better. The cappuccino is one of the best in the Vancouver. 
Overall great experience.  Only thing keeping it from 5 stars was the overcooked pork belly, just a little too dry.  Suggest you try. It is still worth the experience."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wonderful everything from start to finish. I had a yummy smoke salmon egg dish, with fruit bowl, waffle hash browns. Large portions. Stellar service. There is a reason there is a giant weekend line (based on the queue line they have set outside."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Totally worth the wait. My husband and I got here 15 minutes before opening time and we stood right in the middle of the line. We were lucky enough to be one of the first few people inside. 
We sat down and were immediately attended to. Staff quickly provided us service, took our food order, and offered coffee & water refills the entire time. 
As far as the food goes, the portions were huge. That didn't stop us from getting a Baby Dutch (with Apple cinnamon substitute) pancake on the side. It was amazing. It was sweet, warm and toasty. A great start to the day. 
The fried chicken Benedict on the other hand was a whole new experience. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The spices, the sauce, and corn was what made it unique from most places that serve fried chicken. 
Oh and I can't forgot about their homemade jalapeño sauce, that too was delicious. Didn't have to ask for ketchup."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,First time coming here and I don't think I'll be coming back for awhile. The line here is crazy long even for a weekday. Be prepared to spend 2+ hours here with waiting in line and for your food. The food was very meh. A lot of the hyped up breakfast places in Vancouver are either meh or super meh. If you do decide to come here I recommend getting the bowls. They're usually worth it.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A feast for your eyes and mouths. Been here about 4 times already and safe to say non of those times I got in without a wait. 

The food and drinks are amazing, The fried chicken and french toast is my favorite and pairs really well with their grapefruit mimosa. Also, you might need coffee to pick yourself up after such a decadent meal. 

There are a few healthy options as well which includes eggwhie omellets and fruit bowls 

I absolutely love this place and recommend everyone should try it atleast once."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Not worth the price and wait. (I waited a total of 2 hours for seating and food). 

I ordered an iced coffee and the Charlie bowl. 

The Charlie bowl was bland and filled with potatoes and biscuits. Not even the jalapeno sauce could save it. This gets a 0/5 from me. 

The 1 star is from the good service and the iced coffee. (and the fact that I can't give 0 stars on Yelp). 

Would not come back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One thing is certain, there will be a wait. We went on a Friday at around 11 and we stood in a line, to stand in a line! Doubles lines! All the Yelp reviews said the wait was worth it, so we decided to stick it out. It took us about (a party of 5) about 75 minutes to get seated. When you're inside service and wait staff is fast, but there is no rush to get you in and out quickly despite the long waits. This was amazing. 

This is not a typical breakfast spot with a simple bacon and egg dish. The flavors and presentations of each and every dish were amplified. I'm a traditional omelet kinda gal, so at Jam I stepped out of my comfort zone and got something I wouldn't normally get, because every dish looked amazing! Last minute I panicked and ordered the Chicken French Toast. It came with buttermilk fried chicken on top of a brioche french toast drizzled with tobasco honey and jalapeno sour cream, tomatoes, pickled cabbage and green onion.

THE CHICKEN WAS AMAZING. Everything you want from a fried chicken breast, seriously so good. The French toast was good as well, super thick cut brioche. But instead of it being sweet like I wanted, the bottom of the plate was covered with lots of savory sauce, that I didn't care too much for. Must have been the tobacco honey, I wasn't;t a fan, wasn't sweet at all. So when I ate my French toast I just ate the parts that were not touching the sauce. I guess with a French toast I was just expecting something sweet so I didn't enjoy the savory twist. 

All in all my meal was good-- everyone else at my table loved their food. Including the chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken Benedict, egg frittata, and the huevos rancheros. All came highly recommended."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is bomb!! We got there on a Saturday around 10:30AM and there was a bit of a wait. They did mention that it's easier to get people in for parties of 2 but more than that is harder. 

For food, we got the french toast and salmon eggs benny. The french toast came with a cinnamon apple glaze which was not too sweet, and the portion was huge! The benny was also great! The eggs were cooked perfectly, with the right amount of ""runniness.""

Ambience, the place is essentially so cute. The decor gives you so much to ponder at while you're waiting for food, and it kind of just has a homie southern feel.

Definitely coming back to try something different (or not it was that good)!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Oh my drool. 

The lines are insane but it is sooo worth the wait. I went to Vancouver for a 7-day trip and the trip started and ended with this place, we had to come back because it was just that good. If you go at noon on a weekend, the wait will probably be around 1h - 1 1/2h. The staff was amazing and so attentive despite the place being so busy. We never felt rushed and the food came very quickly. 

The food portions are gigantic and pretty heavy. I like that they offer the option of smaller portions for some of their heavier items like their eggs benny or the Charlie bowl. 

Standouts were definitely the red velvet pancakes. They're so fluffy, chocolatey and just overall melt in your mouth goodness. We ordered just 1 to share at the end of the meal and it was the perfect amount. The Charlie bowl is another favourite. So much layered goodness and hidden gems in there but let me tell you, this is enough food to feed 2 people. It is heavvvvvy. 

I'm also a sucker for a good strawberry milkshake and they did not disappoint. You get a full glass plus a little more! 

I can't wait to come back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Short version: it isn't often that something (a restaurant, a movie, etc.) gets recommended very highly and then lives up to that high standard. In this case Jam Cafe lives up to all the positive reviews I read. 

Longer version: we initially went on Sunday morning around 10:00 AM, but found the line halfway down the block (slight exaggeration). A well regarded nearby spot had a 1 hr 20 minute wait, so this was just our fault for trying at such a popular time. Silly us. 

We decided to try again the next morning and found the line *only* about 20-25 people (see picture) so we decided to get in line. Soon a hostess stepped out and very pleasantly went down the line to find out how many were in each party.  After several more minutes she did this again and the group behind us asked her how long it would be. 20-25 minutes was the answer.  Good deal. 

Sure enough the line moved decently fast and we were in the small, tight dining room. The server was cheerful and pleasant. We both got drip coffee and thought it was very good. We struck up a conversation with the couple to my left (we were seated literally inches away from them). The man had what I was considering:  The Charlie Bowl. (Note that it is my experience that Canadian people are exceptionally nice, friendly, and helpful). It looked really good so that confirmed it for me. My wife ordered ""green eggs and ham"".  The server assured us it wouldn't take long. After a longer-that-expected wait (glad we weren't in a hurry) our food came out (the owner brought it to our table... appeared to be just helping out) but mine was wrong. It appeared to be huevos rancheros. He apologized and took both plates away. A few minutes later our server came by and also apologized and said the mess-up was totally his fault.  After several more minutes our food came back out and was correct. The server said they re-made my wife's plate so that it would be fresh and hot.

Oh. My. Goodness. The Charlie Bowl is fantastic!  I highly recommend it. You will likely have leftovers because it's huge.  I'm not a guy who takes pictures of each meal but I took a picture of this one (see attached). There is some house-made hot sauce you can put on your meal. I had some of it but found it unnecessary - it's plenty good without it. My wife says the green eggs and ham was also very good.

At some point the server stopped by to tell us they would ""take care"" of our coffees for us. Which they did (we didn't have to pay for them). 

On the way out I stepped to the kitchen door (in plain sight) and said to the man who initially brought out our food that everything was great. He stopped what he was doing and stepped out to speak with me. Turns out he was Mike, the owner.  We had a brief but very positive conversation. He was interested in hearing my thoughts and then handed me his business card.  

So not everything was perfect, but all the employees were happy and smiling. (Mike said the place had ""really positive energy"" and that was my impression.). They owned up to the mistake that was made, communicated well about what was going on at all times, and even comped us our coffee. And to top it off the food was exceptional. 

Jam Cafe lives up to its high rating. Great job!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long wait, great service, and spectacular food. My friend and I were catching up and decided this was the place to go for brunch. We waited probably for a good 30 - 45 minutes, but it was well worth it. 

The interior is to die for. It's modern and hip. 

The food menu is endless. They have so many options to choose from. I was craving the chicken and waffles, so I got it. It did not disappoint. The chicken was nice and crispy on the inside and tender on the inside. It was spectacular. I also had a poached egg on top and it made the biggest difference. It provided a sauce for the chicken and waffles to go with. I really enjoyed it.

Service, service, service. Hands down can say that this is one the restaurants where service stood out for me. They were super patient with my other and super friendly.

I'd definitely come back again. It is well worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"First time going here with friends after many recommendations and I agree with them: it is well worth the wait, and totally worth the trip. It's just off the Stadium Chinatown skytrain station for those who don't want to bother with finding parking. 

Came here on Thanksgiving Day and even though we left fairly early, the line was long! We waited about 30ish minutes to be seated, and then another 30 for food. Every time I go to brunch I tend to go for the smoked salmon eggs benny because... it's so good-- but ah it was delicious!! The portions were just right and as you can see, my friends and I filled our table up with sides.

I recommend the chorizo and corn bread sides!! The Mac and cheese side was small but very filling so we had trouble finishing it. The sausage side also surprised me! I thought it was going to be sausage links but it came as patties; it was still very delicious though! It was the right kind of spicy . The pancake side was huge so I don't recommend that unless you're starving when you come in

The service was really nice, they had small glass cups but refilled them often. Also they have this jalapeño lime hot sauce on every table and it tastes so good I heard they sold it but I didn't get a bottle!! There is regretti in my spaghetti"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place serves up the best breakfast/brunch items in the city, hands down. The portion sizes are huge and the flavours are always on point. Was recommended by a friend who lived in Victoria (this place originated in Victoria). It's a long wait - they don't take reservations - but a group of 2 can usually get in in under an hour on the weekend. Weekdays are a lot better. There's always a lineup though, so come prepared to wait in line. We grabbed a coffee to keep us warm. 

The fried chicken is oh-so-good. I usually get the chicken over French toast. But really, everything on the menu is good. A lot of restaurants serving breakfast these days offer a la carte, where you build your own plate but $30 later, you end up walking out not completely satisfied. Jam isn't like that. What you order is what you get, big portions of it at that, and you'll always be satisfied. So worth a try!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There was an one hour wait, but aside from that, the atmosphere was good and the food was great. Everyone in my party was satisfied with what they ordered. We were full for most of the day from the heaviness of the breakfast. We had a friendly waitress and did not feel rushed even though there was still a line. I would definitely go back if I am ever in the area again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Hands down the best brunch place I've been to!! My friend and I were visiting Vancouver for a girls' weekend, saw the high reviews and just had to experience it. We got there about 9:30a on a Sunday and waited about 30 minutes. We got seated at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable right from the start! We had a hard time choosing what to order like most everybody else, but chose one of the eggs benedicts and a Dutch baby pancake to share. We also ordered a couple different types of mimosas and we were delighted with every single item! Sooo tasty and we will definitely have to come back next time! Worth the wait, worth the drive, worth the everything!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Possibly one of the best brunch spots in the city.

I'm so used to the brunch scene in SF and NYC that Vancouver never really compared but Jam Cafe is definitely the up there.

The wait is about an hour because the cafe is very small so it makes sense. They did bring out some
Free waffles and thanked us for waiting. The atmosphere inside is very cozy and the staff are super friendly! 

We ordered the fried chicken Benedict with avocado which was amazing. The avocado was PERFECT! and the chicken was so crispy! The blueberry pancakes and pork belly benedict were also amazing. the pancakes and the fried chicken were incredible! Definitely my favourites. 

The hash browns were really cold which was the only disappointment of the meal. I would gladly wait in line again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good coffee, good food, decently priced and good sized portions. There was about a thirty minute wait on a Tuesday morning. It's small but everyone is friendly and was worth the wait in my opinion. Lots of breakfast options that all seem to have a bit of their own twist with vegetarian options."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Everyone said this was the place to go for breakfast/brunch, so I had to give it a try! I was up early on a weekend and arrived at 8:15am (they open at 8) to find a line already out the door and almost an hour's wait. Woah! Fortunately I was all on my own, so I got in early to sit at the bar. If you just want to go and try the food, this definitely seems like the most efficient strategy - I left behind at least a dozen couples or groups who were still waiting in line before me. In the end I waited maybe 30 minutes at most.

Anyway, on to the food - the whole menu looked delicious and it was hard to choose, but eventually I tried the blackstone benedict (eggs benedict with sweet thick-cut bacon). I really like that they offer half benedicts (only one egg and one slice of english muffin) because the normal size is a bit big -- but I would happily have eaten the whole thing in this case. Amazing! the bacon was thick, tasty, perfectly cooked, and a great mix of sweet and salty. The hollandaise sauce was tangy and delicious. Would definitely order again. So yes, definitely lived up to the hype food-wise, but the wait time is obviously a down side. If you do want to come with a partner/group, I'd recommend aiming for a non-peak time or prepare yourself for a wait. Seems the bigger your group, most likely the longer you'll wait.

Edit: came back a second time, on a weekday with a friend. We got there around 9 and the line was just as long as the first time I came, possibly longer. We got lucky though and only ended up waiting about 30 minutes; the 8am settings were starting to change over, and many of the groups ahead of us were larger, so we got called up early when a 2-person table opened up. 

This time I tried the pulled pork pancake and it was absolutely amazing huge as well. I only ordered the half portion, and I couldn't even eat half of that; the full serving must be four meals' worth of food! It sounds like an odd combination, pulled pork and maple glaze on a pancake, but it was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend trying this.

The good news is that apparently another location will be opening in Vancouver somewhere on Main Street hopefully in fall 2017, so here's hoping that reduces the waiting time a bit!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It was my second time returning to dine at Jam Cafe. It is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch joint to eat when in Vancouver! 
This time around I arrived around 8:45am and there was a line, approx 30-40 min wait time. We ended up waiting 30 minutes, which to me is worth the wait. 

As we were waiting for our table, they provide menu to look ahead. We decided to ordered two dishes to share. The Charlie bowl and Chorizo Egg Benedict. Two dishes I highly recommend trying when at Jam Cafe. 
- The Charlie bowl ($14.5 CAD) contains: hash browns, ham, bacon, corn salsa, peas, green onions, cheddar cheese (melts in your mouth), and sausage gravy topping it with two sunny side eggs. It is a huge bowl and man everything in it was sooooooooo YUMMY! Good bang for your buck. 
- Chorizo Egg Benedict ($15 CAD): the best combination with hollandaise, english muffins, and poached eggs. The chorizo sausage was very juicy! 

Overall experience, the dinning room is very cozy, the wait time is worth the wait, the staff is very friendly and the food was outstanding! I highly recommend trying Jam out. Happy Eating :D"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There's a reason you wait in line to get into this cute little restaurant.  Great food and the portions are huge.  I ordered the Charlie Bowl after seeing Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.  But no matter how much I thought I ate there seemed to be a neverending bowl of yumminess..... biscuits,  sausage gravy,  chunks of ham,  bacon and hash browns beneath my 2 poached eggs.  My boyfriend got the gravy coops with fried buttermilk chicken which was moist and delicious.  We both left so happy we had to cancel our dinner reservations because we could not eat another meal."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This is amazing. The line is outrageously terrible but it is definitely worth it! I wish they would open up a bigger place to accommodate more but thats okay. I love how big their portions are! My husband and I couldnt finish our foods and we ordered wayy to much! Lol
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When my sister said ""let's go to Jam Cafe"" for our last meal before heading to the airport, I hesitated, because I had seen the reviews that said there could be a long wait. We decided to go for it anyways and hoped for the best on a Tuesday near 11- in the end, we waited about 50 mins and ate in about 30-40 mins which was enough time for us to take public transit to the airport. 

We decided the share a cinnamon swirl pancake, and I chose the Charlie bowl while my sister ordered the Gravy Coop. I also ordered a Caesar (which was fabulous!) that came in a mason jar with a piece of bacon and some asparagus. Our food followed shortly afterwards- our waitress was quick and efficient even without us telling her we were a bit on a schedule. 

The pancake ($6 plain + $3 flavor) was freaking MINDBLOWINGLY good!!!!!!!! It was also HUGE- upon further reflection we should've shared the pancake and a savory dish. Possibly the best pancake I've ever had, and I usually don't even get the sweet stuff for brunch. I generally favor the savory dishes, but as good as the Charlie bowl was, I decided to finish off my meal with the last quarter of the pancake (saving the best for last!) 

Both the Charlie bowl and the gravy coop were good- my sister was wowed by the fried pork belly. I thought my Charlie bowl was delicious but waaay too much for me. Again, wish we had shared a savory dish and the pancake! 

Overall 5/5. Would definitely come back again!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I found Jam Cafe while in the area and was happy that I did! It was 9:30am on a Monday and there were about 15 ppl lined up outside so I almost turned away. However, I decided to stay as I thought that I might be able to get a spot at the bar, as I was alone. Sure enough, after a couple groups were seated I was able to get in only after waiting a couple minutes. 

I ordered the blueberry lemon triple stack pancakes and the cakes were huge!! They were soft and fluffy, and the sweet and sour flavour was very tasty. I couldn't finish the plate which is rare for me and would probably share it with my wife next time. 

5 stars woulda been rated if it weren't for the restrooms being out of order."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic, ultra-decadent red velvet pancakes. I can see how the pancakes can be a bit much for many, unless if you're like me and crave sweet. And even yet... I had to take half of a two-stack home! 

Top notch biscuits and gravy, and salmon eggs Benedict, which he had. The salmon is very fresh, and the capers complement it very well."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cozy place downtown that meets all expectations and shatters them to form even better ones (there's a reason why a line starts 30 minutes before Jam Cafe opens). Their egg Benedict brought something new to the table with a side of fresh hash browns and a sweet conclusion of assorted fruit and at $14, it's not a hefty price to pay for a filling breakfast. Service is friendly and prompt, but service for the line outside waiting is lacking (every 30 minutes, a hostess will come and tally numbers with no information on wait time, which is disheartening especially when it's raining). 
Only downfall is the wait (9:30-10:15 am for a one person seat at the bar) and their orange juice; for 6 dollars, it was a stale mistake."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The very big downside is that there is at least a 1 hour wait and they require you to stand in line rather than put your name down. It was pouring rain that day. The hostess was nice enough to offer umbrellas to the people who didn't have one. 

Favourite dish of the day was hands down the pulled pork pancakes! It was the perfect balance of savoury, sweet and sour (from the pickled cabbage) - add a bit of green hot sauce and it was the most amazing bite. The pickled pepper on top was also a nice touch. 

We also tried the Gravy Coup and the Salmon Benny - both were unimpressive overall, I wouldn't order them again.

I ordered a Caesar (cuz what's brunch without a Caesar?!) that came with an in-house smoked bacon garnish (AMAZING, BTW) but the Caesar itself was only ok."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Easily my favorite breakfast joint I have been to. I love this place so much.

Second trip to Vancouver in the past year and the only Must Do on this trip, is go to Jam.

We arrived 30 minutes early to be first in line, and we only beat others there by minutes. By the time they opened at 8am (on a Thursday) there were 40+ people in line. We were sat first and ordered right away, only to notice the line just getting longer, as the place was already full. 

The pan fried oatmeal and eggs benny are top shelf good. The staff is awesome. But the quality of food is on a new level. 

Thank you Jam for keeping up the consistency allowing each of my visits to be as enjoyable as the last. 

I highly recommend this joint to anyone who enjoys breakfast foods!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Only a 3-star purely because I feel it's one of those hyped ""wait-in-a-line because your friend said it was amazing"" type of brunch spots. I did like the food when I went and was lucky enough to meet some friends who had already waited in line for our table. 

Still, I felt it was tiny, the line was ridiculous, and the food wasn't so amazing that it's ever compelled me to wait in the line vs. walking two doors over and grabbing a quick table at Chambar. I just saw there is a location in Kits that looks way bigger, so will definitely check it out!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So let me start off by saying that the food was  really really good . I had a tater tot breakfast bowl that had pork and a really great corn salsa. Also, the salsa they provide on the table was delicious.

Cons:
Wait was soooo long. On a Wednesday!!
I think they should allow for reservations or even call aheads.

Second, I asked if they could add jalepenos to my bowl (I was thinking pickled but they gave me fresh which I ended up not using). They charged $1.50 extra for what couldnt have been more than 20 cents of chopped jalepenos. I think if something that could be thought to be a very cheap addition is going to cost extra the server should tell you as much. The waitress was receptive to my comment and removed the charge but I include this for ppl to be aware when they are ordering."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was the 1.5 hr wait worth it? Let's take a look. 

Food:
I ordered the pork belly benedict, the lady ordered a smoked salmon benedict, and we split a brioche french toast. MAN OH MAN... to answer my question, YES. The food came down, and I'm starring at this thinking ""this is EPIC"". The pork belly was roasted to crunchy PERFECTION. Every bite had a perfect taste of pork/smoked salmon, egg, and tang from the hollandaise all soaked into the muffin. The french toast was OFF THE WALL type good. Perfectly sweetened with syrup, caramelized apples, and bananas. 10/10. 

Ambiance:
Tight quarters, so get cozy with your dining neighbors. Very hipster-esque, even to my San Francisco standards. No complaints since the restaurant was well-ventilated. 

Service:
10/10. No complaints. Servers were very attentive and helpful. 

Parking:
Located downtown, it was quite difficult to find metered/street parking. There was a garage across the street, so you'd be better off paying there. Not a local, so wouldn't have any other tips aside from that!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Summary: Wonderful food with a great variety of choices for breakfast. Highly recommend but warn that it is a very small venue that requires you to line up early. At 8am on Saturday and Sunday there is already a line out the door. Looks like it would be difficult to handle parties greater than 6. I had a party of 6 who lined up outside the door at 7:43. We met the cut off to get in as the first round of people!

Food 5/5: Everything was amazing. I ordered the cinnamon cream cheese swirl pancakes and they were instantly my favorite. The red velvet are apparently their famous pancake but I don't think they could compare to the cinnamon. I was able to try the sausage, hash browns, chicken and waffles, and smoked salmon Benedict. I think out of everything my pancakes were the best! The sausage was a little dry but I put their tomatillo sauce on it and it was amazing. I was actually hoping to buy a bottle of the tomatillo sauce but there's no way I'd be able to get it home. 

Venue 5/5: The venue is very cute but rather small compared to others. Our party of six was fortunate to take the table next to the window and it was sufficient. 

Service 5/5: The service was quick and everyone was very friendly. She also was very informative regarding purchasing the tomatillo sauce which I really appreciated. 

Definitely recommend this place and hope they'll sell their tomatillo sauce online!! If they shipped to the US I'd buy so much!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When I hear there's a line, I need to go stand in that line. After doing research on the best brunch places in Vancouver B.C., our first stop was Jam Cafe. There was, of course,​ a line at the door as the reviews stated, but we only waited for about 30 minutes around 2PM. Their twist on comfort food is totally worthy of your Instagram feed and tastes better than your typical brunch joint. Also, the portions are huge. The dishes look so pretty and we couldn't help, but look at what other people ordered around us. The brunch scene in Vancouver is definitely worth another visit."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I live in Portland, OR. I want to live in Canada... well Jam Cafe to be exact!!! My girlfriend and I have contemplated driving there on a weekend just for breakfast. That's how good it is!! You can't go wrong with anything you order! I would highly recommend the skillet (as seen in my pic) or the cinnamon roll pancakes! Beyond recommending, you HAVE to get the caramelized wonderful bacon!


Bottom line--- They say when in Rhome... But the truth is, When in Vancouver! You must go!!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"MY FAVOURITE BRUNCH SPOT!

I would recommend buying a a drink before braving the massive line up, especially during a weekend. We came here on a Sunday at 10am,  and we waited in line for about an hour (which was a short wait, thanks to the crappy weather). 

Once we were inside the restaurant, we were promptly greeted by our friendly server. We knew exactly what we wanted (we had a lot of time studying the menu while in line) - Charlie bowl, Veggie bowl and Farmer's Breakfast Skillet. REMEMBER to come hungry or the verge of hangry because the portion is huge. If you are expecting healthy vegetarian food, sorry, this is not your restaurant.  

The dishes were all very delicious! The Charlie bowl is stuffed with crumbled biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, topped with sausage gravy with two sunny eggs and cheese.  The veggie bowl is very much the same, only without the meat and topped with mushroom sauce.  The farmers breakfast skillet is like an omelette with Sausage, bacon, on hash browns and topped with cheese, green onions and tomatoes, It comes with a choice of toast and homemade blueberry jam (must try)! I could only make a small dent in my veggie bowl and had to pack it home. They also serve JJ Beans coffee which is my absolute love. Oh man... our bellies were all satisfied and ready to hit the bed from a food coma. 

The food and service here is always consistently amazing. I highly recommend it (:"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had eggs, hash browns, bacon (great!) and coffee. All of it was great. One thing I would suggest though is to go to the Kitsilano location. There was a fairly long line that seemed to be there all day."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A local friend of ours suggested Jam for brunch on Saturday morning. We got there just before 10 and waited an hour and a half for a table. While we were in line a restaurant employee came out and offered everyone waiting in line a piece of waffle and some delicious maple butter to dip it in

The service was great and quick once we were seated. The meals were delicious. I had the gravy coop with pork belly. The serving size was more than generous (no one in our group finished their meal)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I thought their red velvet pancakes were to die for then I tried their brioche French toast with stewed cinnamon apples and I went to heaven. 

The softest French toast with caramelized stewed apples yet crispy on the outside. Not too sweet and with the right balance of cinnamon. Such guilty pleasure of epic proportions. I was extremely sad that I finished it and licked the plate clean. Can't wait to be back. 

This place is very busy for brunch and be prepared to wait at least at hour or more to get in but service is efficient and meals are on your table promptly. 

Be forewarned that tables are very close together that you can hear every word from both tables next to you. However there isn't much talking once food arrives. 

Fantastic place for brunch you don't want to miss if you're in Vancouver and it's absolutely worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"After hearing about my coworker rave about this place for months, we finally settled on a day to come so I can try her definition of ""best breakfast"". We got here at around 7:30am on a Sunday, and there were already people lining up (they open at 8am). Thankfully, we managed to be part of the first batch of people to get seated.

I was initially going to order the Charlie Bowl, but my coworker didn't recommend it and said it looked like a hot mess XD. Instead, I settled for the Farmer's Breakfast Skillet. It was pretty good, as I am a big lover of eggs and mushroom together. While it wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had, the portions are very big and I ate the other half for lunch later that day.

Service was friendly, but the waitress pretty much just took our orders and brought out the food, there was nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary. It could have been a counter service restaurant for all I know (and would have preferred that, so we can save on the tipping).

Worth a try due to all the hype, but probably won't be a regular here as I don't live/work in the neighbourhood and there are too many other places to try!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yup, it's worth the hype. I took one of my BFFs here for his birthday on a thursday (weekday). We rolled up at around 11:30 and waited over an hour. We were steadfast. We didn't waiver. We just kept patting eachother on the back and telling eachother how great it would be and...
it didn't disappoint!
The boys had chicken and waffles, I had a half order benny, we all had some delicious cocktails. Our server was attentive, the place was suitably hipster-esque, and it was rammed (not a pro except the testament it shows). 

If it weren't for the ridiculous line up I'd have been back there already."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Very popular breakfast place. Got inline  on Sunday at 7:50 and when they opened at 8 we were able to get in. Very cute & friendly servers. Great options for breakfast. The Charlie Bowl is huge, you can easily share it. You can get half order of eggs Benedict which is brilliant. Fun atmosphere."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I can't believe I didn't find the place until almost the end of my second trip to Vancouver because this place was Amazing! By far the best brunch in Vancouver.

I went with a friend one Friday afternoon (1 pm). Even at that time, there was about a 20 minute wait. Don't be intimidated by the line. It's well worth the wait.

Once seated, be prepared for  not only an amazing food but service experience. To start, I enjoyed a Bloody Caesar (Canadian version of a Bloody Mary). The mix they used was delicious and the thick cut bacon as garnish was phenomenal. For an entree, I went with the chicken and waffles. The chicken was like a country fried chicken and this worked great because it was accompanied by a delicious sausage gravy. 

Whether you can eat all of this or not..the other thing worth ordering are their pancakes. The cinnamon swirl pancakes was as though a cinnabun and pancake had a baby. One bite makes you sit back in your chair and think about how amazing life is. The banana walnut pancake is also delicious. The other great thing is that you don't have to commit to an entire order of pancakes. They let you order a single pancake. Don't be fooled, however, because even the 1 pancake is large.

If I ever go back to Vancouver, I will be sure to return to this gem of a restaurant!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Officially a tradition to eat here every time I'm up in Vancouver and the food is always incredible. I seem to be systematically trying everything on the menu and so far, each meal has been a home run!

We arrive at 750am on a Sunday (they open at 8) and by the time we got in line a few minutes later, there were about 15 people in front of us, give or take. If you want to eat right away when they open, getting here 15 mins early should make that doable!

I decided to give their Eggs Benny a try and went with the Smoked Salmon version, eggs over medium and a side of fresh fruit. Mom got the Brioche French Toast with caramelized apples and cinnamon which we shared so we each got 2 pieces.

The eggs benny was perfect. Eggs were cooked just right. Loved the hollandaise sauce on top of the english muffin. When you cut a bite to get a little salmon, egg, english muffin, and hollandaise, it's definitely a party in your mouth. My fruit bowl tasted great. Lots of pineapple, some kiwi, strawberry, orange pieces, and grapes.

The french toast was unbelievable. Like pretty much everything else they serve, words don't do them justice and you'll just have to experience it. But big thick pieces, perfectly cooked, with that lovely hint of sweetness that comes from the brioche bread, the caramelized apples and syrup all mingling together to provide you with a moment of food bliss. mmmmm

I've waited in line over an hour and been lucky enough to not wait in line at all but in both instances, Jam Cafe is worth it! Eat here."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I know there are already quite a few rave reviews but I can't help to add mine because they are really that awesome!
It's my 2nd visit here and this recent one, we were a table of 3. There is a bit of a wait and even slightly longer for us. 3 parties of 2 went ahead of us but the hostess was uber nice and kept us updated each time she came to grab the next party of 2. 
The service is impeccable, despite it being so busy. I never felt like I was being rushed. 
The food is spot on and really decent portions. Hashbrowns are the shredded type and not oily at all. Will come back to try more items off their menu!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When: Friday, non-holiday, summer

Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Worth the wait!!!!! Sooo worth the wait. 
Portions are massive. Service is excellent. Food is dynamite!! Going to go again before we leave."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Soo the wait was about an hour at noon on a Saturday, but I can see why. It was soo good! I felt it was worth the wait with so many great food and drink options. I had the Cracker Jack and it was delicious! My friend had the Apple Cinnamom French Toast which was also yummy. Nice size portion and friendly staff too. I plan to come back, even with the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My husband and I visited Jam Cafe while on a visit to Vancouver to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had already bookmarked this restaurant on Yelp, but coincidentally our Lyft driver had recommended us to go here as well! We arrived early on a Friday morning, about an hour after they opened. There was already a long line formed outside the door! We waited about 20 minutes (not bad!) before we were seated inside. 

The decor was great, very vintage + rustic. The service was amazing, our waitress was extremely friendly and checked on us frequently. I ordered the Jammer mimosa and chicken & waffles. My husband ordered one of their Bloody Mary's and the chicken brioche French toast. Everything was delicious!!! I was so surprised at the size of our plate, they definitely didn't skimp on the food. My waffles were nice and fluffy, the chicken absolutely delicious, and the gravy was the perfect finishing touch. 

Everything about our visit was nothing less than superb. Now I know what all the hype is about! Brunch doesn't get much better than this :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Totally worth the wait!! We waited in line for about 30 minutes. Small, quaint breakfast joint. The pulled pork tater tot bowl was amazing! Very attentive service. They absolutely deserve the 5 stars!! Check out this place, you won't regret the wait"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Hands down the best brunch I've ever had, and staff is really friendly. Waited a little more than an hour on a Friday morning, but it was so worth the wait.

I got the Harrison Salmon Scramble, and everything about it was perfect. Salmon was not too salty like others I've tried, bean salad was flavorful, and the toast with the onion cream cheese was a thick slab of goodness! Usually when I get thick toast, it's too hard or overly crunchy. But this bread was super soft and baked just right. 

My mom got their waffle special with mango and coconut cream, and it was heaven. I'd be willing to go back and wait another hour just to try their other dishes."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"What is there to not love this brunch spot...
1) bottomless brewed coffee (aka attentive server) 
2) generous portions. I left with boxes for snacking later
3) really really delicious food! We got the farmer's scramble and French toast. Strongly recommended 

I am definitely coming back to this place! But maybe on a weekday to shorten the wait time"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Skip the line, go to Deacon's Corner for no wait, cheaper and better food.  Jam Cafe is adorable and the menu is extensive - that's its strength.  They have some really amazing looking dishes and ample portions but if you look a little closer they aren't serving any more of the good parts of the food than anyone else, they're serving bread and potatoes.  Jam Cafe is like the Anton's of breakfast places!  Was the food good? Sure.  If you want Chicken and Waffles or Chicken and Biscuits with gravy you'd be much better served at Deacon's. Deacon's is significantly cheaper, the chicken is MUCH better and you get more than a thimble full of gravy.  

Is it good, sure, is it great, meh, will I go back? Unlikely. Glad I tried, it though since the line would suggest it is a phenomenon.  Not so much."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As everyone else suggests: brace yourself, a wait is coming. I've been to Jam Café twice, both on weekdays and both times we waited roughly 15 minutes for a party of 4 and a party of 3. This brunch spot has built somewhat of a cult following in my opinion. They have a serious winning combination of interior décor, mouthwatering dishes, inexplicably hospitable wait staff, and an enigmatically long line - which most certainly adds to the mysterious allure altogether. 

The first time I ventured here, I had the Charlie Bowl. Large. Damn. Ever wonder what Snorlax ate to become elephant sized? Have one of these bowls. Caution, if you do not finish, you'll still be slapped with food coma regardless. The ""hash with crumbled biscuit, hash browns, diced ham, green onions, cheddar and sausage gravy topped with two sunny side eggs"" is a serious-no-funny-business breakfast meal for a starving family of 17. The hodgepodge of the bowl comes together very well, the bowl is so massive you can combine 5 or 6 different types of bites (eggs and hash browns, or ham and some gravy, or green onions and biscuits) before you realize you're a grown man playing with food, trying to figure out how to navigate the remainder of the delicious meal without exploding.

The second time I came here, I had the blackstone benedict, ""two poached eggs, sugar cured bacon and roasted tomatoes with classic hollandaise over a toasted english muffin."" Definitely not as adventurous as the other menu items but still tasty nonetheless. Learn from me, avoid the regular items here and go straight for the abnormalities. My friends had the pulled pork pancakes and chicken and waffles. Absolutely savory. One thing to consider, with power comes responsibility. Just kidding, with high demand, comes high prices. The average entrée is about $15.00. I'm from the states, NYC, in particular, and even that is a bit commanding in my opinion. But with people waiting 30-45 minutes, business is a-booomin'.

See you guys next time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've never been one to stand in brunch line ups, but my friend was in town and insisted we go to Jam and omg, I'm drooling just thinking about it. Milkshakes and fried chicken and waffles - perfect coffees, colorful benny's. I loved it here so much. Yummmmm."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's just ok. I don't understand what the whole kerfuffle is with the long ass lines out the door and down the block. I wouldn't describe the experience as transformational at all.  The food is ambitious and the portions are massive. The menu however, it feels almost too much though and too overdone. Everything seems to have way too many ingredients in it and that ruins the dishes in my irrelevant opinion which nobody asked for. If you must be a piglet like me and indulge in the  bowls, I would probably recommend gravy on the side.  The gravy is super rich, and oddly a lot of the dishes seem to have peas in them. Weird. 

The service is excellent and they do a bang up job but them lines...holy crap. 8am on a Sunday and it's down the block with scenesters trying to get their brunch on. I thought I was in LA for a minute with all these folks milling about about trying to look cool. One guy was bizarrely wearing a Dodgers jacket, so maybe I'm not far off of the types of person whom this place attracts.  I wouldn't recommend this for parties larger than 2 otherwise you will waiting for awhile in potentially inclement weather while people linger."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Considering becoming a Canadian citizen just so I can come here for brunch every weekend! Waited in line for about 1-1.5 hours, but totally worth it. 

Food was incredible, and I wish I had the stomach to finish my whole meal.  Perfect meat to fried goodness ratio on the chicken, and the French toast had just enough sweetness without being overkill.  The coffee (with a lot of kick ) was also divine, but what I really want to rave about is the service!  

Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We had a few people with dietary restrictions and she went out of her way to accommodate them and give suggestions on how to make their dishes fit their needs.  Our food also came out late (and one came out wrong) because there was a huge to go order that threw everyone in the kitchen for a loop, but she was extremely apologetic and gave us a huge discount and free fruit!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I went there with high expectations, and unfortunately it disappointed me big time. The food is not something special and seems to be more tourist trap considering silly long wait time. I'd avoid this place forever."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was the line really worth it? I mean we were in line for over an hour on a Thursday for lunch. 

The food was great and unique and all, but that was a long wait! 

We ordered the chicken French toast and the pork belly Benedict. The chicken was fried just perfectly and seasoned well. The French toast was a unique twist as most places do waffles. The sauce that was drizzled over the waffles added the perfect accompanying flavours.  The pork belly Benedict was not as appealing in terms of presentation. It looked over cooked but it doesn't have the overdone texture when you actually taste it. It wasn't as good as I had imagined it to be."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My cousin brought me here when I was visiting from California. We got there about 7:45 on Thursday morning and the first wave line was already full, but we were able to get in and get a table when they opened the doors. Love the vintage-like decor and the friendly service. 

I was trying to decide between the Veggie Bowl, the Veggie Benedict, and waffles and I'm glad I went with the veggie benny! It was the perfect portion. I didn't want to take leftovers since she was taking me to explore downtown. I ate everything and it was filling, but not heavy. The English muffin was perfectly toasted and the hollandaise, oh so buttery.  The seasoned hash browns with the roasted tomato were the perfect complement. I also loved the iced coffee!

My cousin's husband ordered the veggie bowl and he said it was okay and it was too much food. I had a bite of my cousin's waffle and was glad I passed on that. I had better waffles from the breakfast buffet waffle maker in my hotel in Portland.  I'm glad what I ordered was worth the wait in line and the wait for the food to arrive! After Vancouver, I also drove through Seattle, Portland, and back thru California, and I'd have to say that Jam Cafe's veggie eggs benny was my favorite meal on this trip!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brekkie at Jam Cafe! Heard a lot of good things about this place. Today was cold and we hope it wouldn't be too busy at 8:30am.... but luckily we were second in line. Apparently, if you don't get here when it opens you will have to wait for a while, guess we were lucky today. 

We ordered a Veggie bowl and a Charlie bowl. I caved and got a pancake (cinnamon cream cheese). In summary, it was a lot of food for two! We should have ordered one bowl and one pancake to share.... 

The cinnamon cream cheese taste exactly like a cinnamon bun! love it! The only thing i recommend would be, that they put a lot of syrup at the centre when they serve it. This causes the centre of the pancake to be very soft and soggy. If you don't like that, ask them to put the syrup on the side. Enjoyed the pancake a lot!

I recommend the Veggie bowl over the Charlie bowl, mostly because the Charlie bowl has the same flavour and texture throughout and there is a lot of biscuit. The biscuit was very good, but too much in the Charlie bowl. The Veggie bowl on the other hand has different array of flavour and texture because of all the veggies! The gravy they put in both bowls is an amazing addition to the bowl and definitely required on the biscuit. Portion of both bowls are very Large and filling, photos are deceiving, but looks amazing!! ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you only do one breakfast/brunch in Vancouver, let it be this one. 

To say the food is delicious is an understatement! The menu is inventive, the flavor profiles are sublime, the execution is on point and the service in super friendly. 

Yes, the wait times can be brutal but definitely worth it.

Cinnamon swirl pancakes are out of this world."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Everything was perfect! Excellent service. Delicious coffee. And the best Parmesan fries! Highly recommend!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yum, this breakfast lived up to the hype! We went early Friday morning and thankfully avoided any line. The tables are indeed very close together but it's understandable considering how many people want to eat here. 

We had a tough time deciding what to order and after a suggestion from the staff we decided to split the little veggie (there's nothing ""little"" about it) and triple stack pancakes (cinnamon cream cheese swirl). The little veggie was tasty, but a little too heavy on the hashbrowns. It was hard to find the veggies in it. The other hard part is that it comes in a very deep bowl so it's hard to mix everything together and get to all the tasty bits. The pancakes were the real star of the show: thick, soft, and oh so cinnamon-y. We were sold when they told us it would taste just like a cinnamon bun -- and it really did. We would go back just for that."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is a MUST try (at least once, if not more as long as your stomach can handle all the carb-y goodness). The wait time at 10am on Sunday was about 30 minutes. We opted to sit at the bar for a shorter wait time, which turned out to be a nice and cozy spot. We ordered the:

1. The Vegetarian Bowl (14.5) - Crumbled Homemade biscuits, hashbrowns, two sunny side up eggs, bell peppers, green onions, corn, salsa, cheddar cheese, mushroom gravy on the side. Think of this as The Gravy Coops (w/o fried chicken), except all mashed together into a bowl so that you get a bit of each ingredient in each bite. The first few bites were 'make your eyes roll back amazing'. Then, it started to get really heavy, so I had to pack home leftovers. BUT, the leftovers were just as amazing for a late night snack!
2. The Gravy Coops (16.5) - Fried chicken, Homemade biscuits, topped with 2 sunny side eggs, green onions, peas, sausage or mushroom gravy. This was also so delicious. 

If you are visiting or even a local, this place is a must try! Expect to leave stuffed and happy. 
*Parking: Street/metered parking."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The veggie bowl was a heck of a monstrosity of food, but incredibly delicious. It definitely packed us up for the big hikes that day and I'm glad for their mushroom gravy. It was the best veggie bowl I've ever had. It gets busy, so plan accordingly! It opens at 8 so be there 15 minutes earlier."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great menu selection but the quality was just okay for us. Pancakes weren't soft and fluffy but rather hard and dry. Old town breakfast's sausage was also hard and dry. Got really excited from the photos and reviews but the breakfast didn't deliver. Not to also mention we waited 45 minutes in line plus another 30 minutes for our food to arrive, it definitely wasn't worth it for us. First time here (visiting from the US) and probably our last. On a positive note the service was excellent despite how busy they were."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Amazing breakfast!!! Definitely worth the long wait so make sure you get there early. Try the French Toast with strawberries & bananas.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best brunch places out here in Vancouver! It's very well decorated inside and feels like Canadian style home. It's not a big restaurant and it's first come first serve. Make sure you go earlier than usual to line up and it's about 30 minutes wait on average. However, it's worth the wait with big portions. Jam cafe has spectacular customer service and great food. Most of their dishes are tasty and it's a very generous portion. I would highly recommend this place for brunch in Vancouver but make sure you go early!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My friends and I came here for brunch. I had already informed my friend that the lineup and wait time would be long on weekends. They said it was alright to wait as we would stand in line and chat for a long time. We waited for more than an hour and half!! 

We ordered frittata, chicken 'n waffles and the gravy coop for brunch. All of them tasted great and the portion was big, so all of us packed some food home. Indeed Jam Cafe is more unique and special when we compare it with IHOP, Cora, White Sport and etc.  Their fried chicken was crispy and tender. The sausage gravy is like a creamy sauce with some minced meat. Waffles were so thick and tasty.

Overall, we had a great eating experience at Jam Cafe; however waiting in line took the longest that we had ever had, so we were not sure if we would like to come back here for brunch unless we come early when they open at 8am or late in the afternoon around 2pm or after."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Super yummy- totally worth the wait!!! Had the tater tot bowl and the frittata. Highly recommend both. French toast was ok- just got a side but it wasn't super special.  But the bowl was phenomenal!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"""We just got jammed!"" said my husband after we waited in a TWO HOUR LINE to eat here. Holy smokes. Look the food is good. We picked this place for the red velvet pancakes and they did not disappoint. They were incredibly fluffy and filling, but this place does not live up to the hype. It's too late for me but it's not too late for you. Give yourself two hours of your life back and go have lunch somewhere else!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,the best brunch i've ever had. i'm not from vancouver but i've never had anything like this in toronto. the chicken and french toast are spectacular! the sauce comes together so well with the french toast and chicken. the portions are very big but it was so good i had to have it all
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Frittata was pretty good. Customer service was terrible. The lady who showed us in after a 30 min wait was nice. But our server was another lady who was awfully rude. From getting The place can't seem to handle brown people. Also, we were stuck in line  in front of a group of obnoxious 4 ppl who also were clearly troubled by our non-whiteness. So maybe this place is great but only for ppl of a certain color"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Really a 4.5

Wow was this place worth the wait!
I chose to go on a week day to avoid the lines I've seen on the weekends. I do detest places that don't take reservations.  It's so archaic.

We lucked out and got a nice booth by the window for just the two of us. So comfy, they had to be the best seats in the house lol.  The service was so amazing. Everyone is friendly, professional and on the ball.

We ordered the pulled pork pancakes, the gravy coop and pancakes on the side (because I  need something sweet to end my brunch).

Our savory dishes were delicious.  I was so full and was disappointed I couldn't finish my gravy coop. It was so good. I couldn't even put a dent in the side pancakes (which I didn't love though they looked beautiful.) Love the maple butter though.

I am definitely coming back! I highly reccomend this place! My new favorite brunch spot in the city....if I can get in! Lol"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Once you're through the door you will be so glad you waited in the line. Choices abound for both breakfast and lunch choices served all day (until 3pm in YVR). Serving size is ample and we all had take home boxes. Some hardy, meaty choices as well as vegetarian options. Bright, clean and airy feel with trendy decore and friendly knowledgeable staff. When we were there they would not seat a large party unless everyone was onsite. Which makes sense because I might be a wee bit chapped if someone held up a large number of seats while we waited for a table for three."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We arrived and had a 2 hour wait in line before being seated however it was worth the wait. The service was great and there wasn't a moment of having to wait for the staff to assist us. The food was cooked within a short time and tasted great. If you don't mind waiting to eat, this is a great breakfast/brunch location."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Arrived around 10ish and waited over an hour in the cold rain for this place and I don't think it was worth it. I love breakfast/brunch food and was not wow'ed by the food... only the portion size. The restaurant is cute and cozy. Very rustic and has a lot going on inside. 

- Charlie bowl - (3/5) - crumbled biscuit, hash browns, ham, bacon, corn, salsa, peas, green onions, cheddar cheese, sausage gravy and two sunny side up eggs. ($14.50)

- The gravy coop - (3/5) - buttermilk fried chicken in between a buttermilk biscuit with hash browns, peas, sausage or mushroom gravy, and two sunny side up eggs. ($16.50)

As you can see from the description, they are practically the same dish, presented differently. The Charlie Bowl is what everyone raves about and it is just a bowl full of carbs. Both items were good, not great, and needed the salsa to come alive. There definitely is enough food to have leftovers though, which we did. 

Would I come back? No. Way too basic to be wasting an hour in line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Possibly the best brunch I've ever had, in any city. Worth the 1 hr 15 min wait, even at 7:45am on a Sunday. 

The food - Everything on the menu looks amazing, but we ended up getting the Fried Chicken French Toast, Buffalo Fried Chicken Benedict, and the Pigs in a Blanket. All of it was ridiculously over the top good. Oh and fresh grapefruit mimosas with a gooseberry!

The restaurant - super cool food themed art and an incredibly nice staff. Even though it was insanely busy, and hands down had the longest wait for any restaurant I've ever been to, they never made you feel rushed and we felt like we had enough space to comfortably enjoy our meal. 

10/10 would drive up from Seattle just for brunch again..... but hopefully they just open up down here!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I recently returned to Vancouver ( was living in Toronto for 3+ years) and wasn't too excited/optimistic about new places to try in the city. But so glad I came across Jam Cafe. I can't wait to be back ! Food was delicious , iced coffee was great ! But so surprised that there was a line up at 1pm on a weekday, only in Vancouver"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Ordered the waffle with chicken. Chicken was ok a bit dry and hard the waffle was cold hard and very chewy. Could barely cut it with the serrated knife   Gravy cold. Coffee was good. Was not worth the 45 minute waIt
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So everyone knows by now that the line ups are HUGE! We came yesterday at 1:15 and still waited 45 minutes. We sat at the bar which I highly recommend because you have constant service in an already JAM packed, small place. 

I ordered the veggie bowl (biscuits, shredded hash browns, veg, cheese, 2 eggs, and mushroom gravy). This thing was bigger than my head. Get the little bowl or split this! And I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy so I ordered a side of hollandaise which was better. I made a solid dent in this bad boy but still had half of it to go.

My babes ordered the blackstone benny (she also recommends ordering half) and was in heaven. She said it was the best bacon she has ever had! It's accompanied with their famous hash browns and roasted tomatoes. It looked amazing. And last, the chicken and waffles. HUGE! 

Totally delicious and great prices. The service was phenomenal (I think her name was Kim). I will definitely come back!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Thank god we were still on EST zone because getting here at 8:30 means no line up on a Friday!  By 10am, a line was already forming outside the resto.  People were lining up in the rain!! 

I was debating between the smoked salmon egg Benny vs the little Charlie, based on the server's recommendation, I went with the Benny. In hindsight, I probably should have went with something different and chose the Charlie because the Benny just tasted like an average Benny. Don't get me wrong, it was still good but I just wish I got to try something different. The rosti that came with the dish was crunchy but didn't have much taste to it. 

Overall, I left the resto satisfied but indifferent to returning. I never give half star ratings but there is a first for everything I'm gonna give Jam 3.5 stars."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is good. Get the fried chicken. I have dined in once and taken out once. You definitely want to dine in to get the best of their food. Only problem is there is always a line up outside.

We live close-by, so we have driven by probably a 100 times to check the line. We made it in with a relatively short line once, and since then every time we drive by the line up seems to be longer and longer. So good luck eating here."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"BEST BRUNCH EVER!!!! 
So be ready to wait!! We waited in line in the rain for over an hour (about 1.5 hours) but it well well WORTH IT!!  Thank you Yelpers for this great recommendation.  TIPS:  it's rainy in Vancouver in January so be prepared with umbrella and rain gear for the wait.  Once we got in, the SERVICE was OUTSTANDING!!  They have amazing staff and all are engaged in the job, care about the customers and extremely attentive.
We started with the CLASSIC JAM CEASAR which garnished with pickled asparagus spear and sugar candied bacon.  My hubby had 2 as he loved it!! I had a Vanilla Hot that had a shot of espresso, tia Maria, got chocolate and vanilla vodka and was sooo good!!! 
I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken is so tender and amazing. Hubby ordered The Gravy Coops with pork belly.  We also ordered a lonely piggy which was divine.
LONELY PIGGY is a maple sausage dipped in pancake batter, fried and served with maple butter syrup and it is melt in your mouth amazing!
I wish we went with more people as would have loved to try more dishes but we were stuffed.  Portions are substantial and you are guaranteed a great experience. I can't wait to go back!!  I just have to figure out when I can avoid a line up but would line up again for that amazing brunch!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wait was short for party of two on a weekday morning. Fresh fruit, imaginative breakfast menu and really caring wait staff. We were in and out in 45 min."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe. The long line is worth the wait. Every. Minute. Friendly service great atmosphere and delicious food. This place is a definite go to for breakfast, brunch or lunch!  The menu has a lot to chose from and several vegetarian options. I highly recommend it"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited in line for about an hour (there were 4 of us). You get seated based on how many people are down eating & leave.  So for example if a party of 2 left the restaurant then they will only seat those waiting in line who are in a party of 2.  I do not recommend a party bigger then 4 to go here!!  It's to your advantage if you are party of 2!  Otherwise it's SO WORTH the wait!  We ordered the 3 stack chocolate pancakes, green eggs & ham, biscuit melt, and naan breakfast burrito.  I personally like the green eggs & ham and the pancakes the best!  I also ordered the buttered rum which was AMAZE BALLS!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yes, the line is long. Yes, there is a wait... BUT I would definitely come back! I can see what the hubbub is all about. I had the chicken and waffles plus had to splurge on that cinnamon pancake. OH MY GOD! That pancake was worth it alone. Think cinnamon bon meets pancake. They let you split it with your fellow diners so you can feel less guilty about the splurge. My sugar levels went through the roof but it was worth it. My BF got the green eggs and ham. All were favorites and for a reason. The service was great too. My only gripe was the poop on the sidewalk while we were waiting. I hope bad karma to those bad dog owners who didn't clean up after them!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ready to brave the line, my friend and I arrived at 8:00am sharp on a rainy Saturday morning. Luckily, we were able to get the last table available.

We were greeted immediately regarding any drinks or questions, and water was served to us right away. For food, after much contemplation, we got the buttermilk fried chicken benedict as well as the cinnamon pancakes. 

I enjoyed the benedict. The English muffin was crispy and buttery, which served as a good base for the benedict. The buttermilk fried chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and I liked the corn salsa that was on top of the benedict. I liked the hollandaise sauce, it had a hint of lemon to it. The hash was crispy, and was a good complement to the bennies. 

I'm glad we only ordered one cinnamon pancake, as it was big! Topped with a cinnamon cream cheese swirl, the pancake with soft and interlaced with cinnamon. It was delicious! 

Service was friendly and quick. By 9:00am, there was already a turnover of tables. I would definitely return!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breakfast I've ever had. Get the breakfast bowl. I got the veggie one with egg. It is best breakfast item I've ever had. 

Highly recommend. Must go."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"7 weeks ago my neighbour told me about the Jam Cafe - he told me to get down there now!

Here we were on this dreary cold Saturday morning waiting in line for 1 hour! Was it worth it ...... oh yeah baby!!!

While in line the host brought out sample waffles with syrup - wow did it ever taste so good waiting in line on a cold morning!

Oh & you will have to stand in line as they do not take names = if you leave you lose your spot! We kept warm by alternating our turn in line - take a walk while someone in your party waits in line - & must have cell phone!

JC is located downtown Vancouver on Beatty St. close to the Stadium sky train station. In fact I highly recommend using transit to get here as we all know how it cost an arm & leg for street parking! And the traffic cops are in full effect - even on Saturday morning - lots of fines issued on over parked cars! On top of that it was game day so there was a heavy Canuck fan presence coming downtown = heavy traffic!!!

This location is nostalgic in that it was the former location for Much Music(Terry D Mulligan where are you!?) Vancouver - it was situated in this very building back in the day!

JC has approximately 20 tables & thus the long wait outside. There is really cool lighting inside & the interior decor on the walls is chic.

We ordered the massive Charlie Bowl - the Gravy Coop & the Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich. We were totally awed by the deliciousness of it all! Fresh, tasty, well presented, huge meals - we loved it all!!!

Be warned - if you're on a diet or not a huge eater - you will be carrying your leftover food home with you!

You definitely get more bang for your buck here from JC's menu!

We got to meet boss Mike & he told us about JC's first location in Victoria. Now had I known & been familiar with JC years back - that sure would have made my trips over to the island more exciting! Oh & thank you Mike for the sample bacon - it was great!

The good news - there are plans to expand to possibly the Kits area and or Main St.!

When I got back home my neighbour asked how was it! I confessed I had to bring most of my meal back home as it was too big for me to finish. He jokingly commented that the CB could feed half our complex! LOL 

JC gets my seal of approval - get here now!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Finally decided to wait in line and see what the buzz is about! Jam Cafe doesn't take reservations, so my friend and I braced ourselves for some waiting time Saturday morning. We arrived at 9:30, and surprisingly we got a table in about 15 - 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad of a wait at all. It's understandable too; the place was very cozy and absolutely packed! 

We ordered some mimosas - one classic and one jammer. I absolutely love the jammer, a great twist to the classic mimosa with more sweetness to it. The green eggs and ham we ordered were HUGE, and plated beautifully. The eggs were so fluffy and paired really well with the goat cheese. The biscuit was amazing! It's definitely worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"All the crazy high reviews got me excited, but unfortunately I was slightly disappointed when I tried it.

Tried their Jam Royale ($8) drink - coffee with a kick. 
Coffee mixed with Godiva chocolate liquor topped with whipped cream. They had me at Godiva. I thought it would taste more like a Half Half (half coffee half chocolate) with a kick of alcohol - you can taste the liquor so that's good. Flavor was okay, wasn't much of my liking but the presentation was nice.

I had the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict ($15)
Two poached eggs, whole fried chicken breast, classic hollandaise topped with roasted corn salsa over a toasted english muffin. The fried chicken was good, nice and crispy but I'm not sure it goes too well with the poached egg on top. The hash was okay, but I expected it to be more crispy - the top and bottom were pan seared with a slight crisp, but not crispy enough. Overall the dish was good, but aside from the holladandaise sauce, there was no other flavor added to it. It says it was topped with roasted corn salsa. but to me it was literally just corn nibblets on top, no added flavor.

My boyfriend had the Little Charlie Bowl ($12)
Even though it was the little version, it was still pretty big. A bowl of potato hash with crumbled biscuit, hash browns, diced ham, green onions, cheddar topped with sausage gravy and two sunny side eggs. The biscuit felt more like bread, which I actually didn't like - I preferred having more of the hash. Lots of ingredients but it just wasn't much of my liking - probably due to the lack in flavor.

Food was ok, overrated in my opinion."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Everything is delicious!!! Thank for your attention, the Benedict eggs are the best I have ever eaten  the next time I go to Vancouver I promise my self to get back!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long line to wait in but definitely worth it in my opinion, I ordered the Harrison salmon scramble that came w a side salad.  and it kept me full for most of my day."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait outside was long even at 2:15pm on Friday afternoon.  The wait for the food was also long, about another 20 mins.  We ordered the Charlie bowl and the Jam frittata.  Both dishes were delicious!  Next time I'll be back to try their French toast and pancakes.  They looked amazing!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Due to the great reviews, I had this on my radar before I even arrived in Vancouver. Luckily, it was near my hotel and the front desk highly recommended it. They even suggested someone head down early to get in line, and there was a line. Still...the reviews made me feel it was worth the wait. Also, a line is usually a sign of good food and a local fave. Weather was good, so I toughed it out even when some of my party decided to skip it and grab Mickey D's. We were told about a 30 minute wait while in line. This was told to us after I had already been in line for awhile. The line did seem to move quickly. The hostess was very good about keeping the line informed on their approximate wait times. I think my actual wait was about 45 from the time I got to the end of the line until we were at the hostess podium for our turn. However, since our party was more than 2, we had an additional wait for a bigger table. The restaurant is very small and houses mostly tables for two. I only saw two bigger tables near the front. Decor is warm, cozy, and rustic. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was excellent. Portions were huge. We had to take some home. I believe the pricing is average for the city. It didn't seem overpriced to me. I'd definitely visit Jam again while in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breakfast I had in Vancouver! Love all the food from here. Definitely try out the pulled pork pancakes! Savory meat and fluffy pancakes makes such a great combo. 

One thing that Jam Cafe can do to improve is to get a list going instead of waiting in line. Since Jam Cafe is nestled in Downtown Vancouver, it would be great to walk around than to stand for an hour or more for breakfast. 

Other than that, come early and enjoy the food!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A........MAZING!!!! We waited a while to get in but Definitely, I mean DEFINITELY worth the wait. Great place to grab some great breakfast to start your day! Breakfast is my favorite meal and this was pleasure to my soul! 

I tried the GRAVY coops and was extremely satisfied! We also ordered a side of pancakes! Super duper yummy!!! I'm a little annoyed that we accidentally left our ""to-go"" box behind!! I was totally looking forward to having it later. 

We also had the salmon scramble which was delicious too!! Staff was GREAT TOO!! The brought out samples to keep everyone content with the long wait, umbrellas, and friendly smiles...they definitely get customer service!! Great job.

In SHORT....GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT VIBE, WORTH THE WAIT!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I drool writing this review and thinking about the breakfast I had at Jam Cafe. My cousins suggested taking us to Jam Cafe during our trip to Vancouver since they've had many brunches at the Victoria location. It was a bit of a wait on a weekday afternoon around 12 since we had a party of 5. It seems like tables for 2 are a lot easier to get tables. The hostess was really nice and cool and keeping us informed on the status of our table. 

We got seated by the window and ordered our meals: Fried Chicken French toast, pulled pork pancakes, pork belly benny, blackstone benny and farmers skillet. I got to try a bit of everything and honestly, everything was amazingly good. The chicken was tender, French toast was perfectly done. Skillet was good, lots of flavour. 

Although I still enjoyed my pulled pork benny, the pork itself was quite fatty (extremely fattier than usual - had to cut the very thick fat and threw it away). I'm someone who knows pork belly would be fatty but usually it would be easy to eat. The pork was not tender and soft. It was a bit chewy. The flavour was good but texture was the only problem I had. 

The pancakes were AMAZING. Fluffy, sweet, savory. Definitely my favourite dish of the day. 

I'll definitely be back at Jam Cafe if I'm visiting Vancouver or Victoria. It totally exceeded my expectations!

Ps. They had some Toronto art work near their washrooms which was cool!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Whenever any of my foreigner friends come to Vancouver to visit, I take them here. The customer service and food is incredible. I think it's impossible to have a bad experience here. There's a reason why the line is so long all the time!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"All the staffs are polite and kind.
Only downside here is you have to line up for a while. 
My favorite food is ""hotcake"" its soft and fluffy. And their sauce is very unique (taste like bases on creamcheese)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here three days in a row! Loved the Charlie bowl, and also the cinnamon roll pancakes. Incredibly busy - if you are alone or with someone, ask to be seated at the bar as it is easier to get a seat!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I got their buffalo fried chicken Benedict and it was SOOOO GOOD. I'm a hoe for eggs Benedict, it's my goto when eating out for breakfast, and I ate all of it. Never even thought of buffalo fried chicken Benedict before....but I guess dreams even if I didn't dream about it, do come true 

Awesome service also"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited in line for 45 mins but then food was definitely worth it....had the pulled pork pancakes...portion was massive. The pork was succulent and juicy. The pancakes were big but light. A really amazing dish. My son had plain pancake and he liked it very much.

The only downside is they wouldn't accommodate me by letting me have another table added on. We were seated at a small table but I needed a 2nd table so I could sit next to my son who has feeding issues and is a special needs child as he needs me to feed him.

Would of been nice if they would accommodate my special needs child but I guess Jam Cafe doesn't accommodate special needs children well at least not my special needs child. Other than that it was wonderful. Would I go again? Maybe, but only if my special needs child is not with me since he didn't seemed welcomed."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Worth the wait. Cute decor and super friendly staff. Our waitress was really helpful in making suggestions on what was popular and can be made gluten free
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long line ups... wroth the wait!??? 

It was.. I think so anyway... 

This place use to be my beloved Cafe Medina location, than turned to another brunch cafe restaurant, obviously didn't last and now Jam cafe.  I've read rave reviews and was very excited to try it out.   

Jam cafe is everything you want in a brunch place.  1. Cute decor / homey and rustic 2.  Good coffee I had a latte 3.  Great brunch/breakfast menu.  4.  Yummy comfort food!

I came on a Sunday morning, (prime brunch day) my friend and I tried to strategically come just before 9am.  It opened at 8am, we figured the first early comers will be out just around 9am.  We arrived at 8:45am and the line was long but as predicted we were in within 15mins.  (Winning!!)

I've pre read the menu, so I know what I was having, this limits the confusion at ordering time.  I stuck to my guns and ordered the Chicken coop.  Big portions, I see why people love this place.  My food was good I love county gravy and the biscuits and fried chicken went well with it.  It was just so much food.  Also came with shredded hash browns.  Good hash!  The menu looked awesome, I need to come back to try the red velvet pancakes yummmm."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited 1 hour and 30 minutes in the rain for this place. And once we were inside, we waited at least 30 minutes more for food. I understand it was busy and crowded but I think part of the reason that the wait was that long was because it took a while to get food. They did provide umbrellas once you got closer to the front of the line.
Food wise, the ingredients they used were very fresh and you could taste the difference. I got the Charlie bowl and it was hearty and unique. However, the biscuit inside made the content of the bowl become a bit dry with inconsistent texture. Also it was on the sweet side which I did not expect. They served their own housemade hot sauce and syrup. I can't speak for the syrup but the hot sauce was really good. It was lightly tangy and not too sour and make a good addition to the bowl.
But overall I was not that impressed with the dishes themselves. I mean, it was nicer than most brunch places but probably not 1.5-hour-wait nicer. 
The waitress that we had was super nice and accommodating considered how busy she was."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been wanting to go to this place for a while after seeing some of the pictures on yelp. There has always been a line every time I drive by, and this day was no different. 
The line up was extremely long (we waited 1.5 hours) Thank goodness the food was so good! 
I started with a hazelnut latte which was good, nothing spectacular but a good latte. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict... yes it is as delicious as it sounds! My boyfriend ordered the Charlie bowl which was amazing. It was a HUGE bowl full of crumbled biscuits, ham, hashbrowns and sausage gravy with cheese. There was still tons to take home after eating for quite some time. We also split the cinnamon twist pancake for my sweet tooth. Yum! I love cream cheese icing, it was like eating a pancake form cinnamon bun.
The waitress was very sweet, saying thank you for your patience due to the line we had waited in. Food was fantastic but I put 4 stars because I think that is too long of a wait no matter how good the food is. I hear they are opening another location in Kits this fall so hopefully that shortens the lineups!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The place isn't that big, this why there is usually a line, but it's worth it. I got the Charlie bowl, one of the more popular dishes and my husband got the pork belly Benedict.   Both dishes were so good and I would recommend them both. We also got a red velvet pancake to share, which I would also recommend you do. It's a popular spot for a reason, some amazing flavorful grub. Can't wait to go back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place lived up to the hype! I even had to wait in line outside for 75 minutes starting at 9:15am on a Saturday, but the food was actually really delicious. I'm not usually a brunch person either. 

I highly recommend the gravy coop $15!!! Buttermilk biscuit (so good) with deep fried chicken breast on top (crispy and yum) and two sunny side eggs on top. I got the gravy on the side. And it also comes with hashbrowns on the side. Sooo good and sooo filling. 

I also had half the strawberries and banana french toast. Very delicious but it's very sweet, like a dessert. It worked out having half half of both dishes because I think this would be too sweet to eat the whole thing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"After a brief wait outside, space is a little limited, we were shown to our table. What a great place! The service was excellent, the food was great...huge portions and great attention paid to both presentation and preparation. Our first visit, to both Vancouver and jam...we will definitely be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited in line on a cold winter morning (1130am) for 1.5 hours to be seated. I wouldn't have had mind if the food was worth it. I tried the Pork Belly Benedict, the buttermilk chicken and the sweet potato fries. 

I found the pork belly and chicken too dry for my liking. The biscuit and the caramelized onion were good. The hash was soggy (I am used to mine crunchy). If it weren't for the amazing sweet potato fries, the brunch would have had a 3 star. The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. The portion was large and the mayo dip was extremely complimentary. I could eat that non stop. 

Service was great once inside the restaurant, my coffee was refilled when the cup was empty. I was checked on twice during my hour meal. I may not be returning for the benedict, but I definitely would return for the sweet potato fries!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came around noon and it was pouring. We were visiting from California and we did not bring an umbrella with us. This place generously offered their own umbrellas to multiple guests waiting outside. I was extremely thankful! 

The service was great -- funny and upbeat waitresses. The food definitely had us in a good coma. Would come back"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,One of my favourite places for breakfast and brunch but you have to stay for a very long time in line to get in.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Totally worth the 1.5hr wait! I got the eggs benny with fried chicken it was really good! Pretty big portion, so you get the bang for your buck! The hollandaise sauce was really good and I liked the addition of the corn on top. Would very much recommend and I'd for sure go back here again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Long line was worth my skillet plate of yummy breakfast.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Absolutely love this breakfast spot.... Definitely worth coming in and having a bite to eat. it's cozy and welcoming. Staff is pleaseant. Every dish looks absolutely delicious!!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I wanted a tasty brunch for my birthday and after searching on them internets and the good ol' Yelp, we decided to come here. This place wasn't far from where we were staying so we walked 5 blocks or so over. We could see there was a long line as we approached and they said it was about a 30 min wait.  We were already there and wanted to try the place, so we waited...but it was only about a 20 min wait. The staff will come out to check with you the amount of people in your party, give you updates on the wait times, if you want coffee they can get you some while you wait.  

When we were seated, we sat at the bar where a friendly bartender gal was there to welcome you. Started out with some coffee and gave us the specials and answered any questions we had.  We knew what we wanted so we proceeded from there and I decided to get that ""Gravy Coop/Coupe"".  Super delicious! A big buttermilk biscuit with fried chicken, 2 eggs, house gravy and hash browns. It was a monster of a dish but it was so good and super satisfying. The fried chicken was super crunchy & moist and just what I was hankering for.  Biscuit was fresh and was wonderful with that sausage gravy all mixed in. I really enjoyed this and would order it again.  

We also got the ""Little Charlie"", it's kind of like a hash but with chopped up biscuits (looked like Thanksgiving stuffing to me)  with ham, cheese, green onions, eggs and sausage gravy. It was very good and very filling.  There's a ""Charlie Bowl"" too, which is even bigger in size, but the ""Little Charlie"" aint so little...he's the big little brother of the other Charlie.  

Staff was great, super friendly, quick and attentive. Place is pretty medium sized but the staff does a great job at counting heads and making room for you. Cool decor, relaxing & inviting. Prices are what we expected and it was fine too.  

So many items looked good on the menu to try, guess Ill be coming back next time I'm in town. Definitely a place for me to come back to and recommend it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Tried lining up for this place 3 times with the boyfriend but our hunger always makes us leave after about 20 minutes of waiting everytime.  We decided to give it another try and finally stuck it out. After about an hour we made it inside!  

I ordered the Charlie bowl and my boyfriend got the old town breakfast. The old town breakfast was pretty average but their sausage patties were delicious. The Charlie bowl was HUGE and the flavors were amazingly delicious. How can a dish with gravy ever taste bad? 

The service was friendly and attentive.  Their special hot sauce was a highlight to the dish!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As we pulled up to find parking, we quickly saw that their was already a line that was formed outside of this quaint little restaurant. Our wait was only about 20 minutes, which was bearable despite our hungry tummies. We ordered their Triple Stack Red Velvet pancakes, fruit bowl, and the Charlie Bowl. The pancakes were a bit too doughy and tasted more like cake than pancakes. However, the cream cheese icing/syrup that was layered on top was one of the best cream cheese icings I've ever had! Not overly cream cheesy and not too sweet! I just wish the pancakes were a little thinner and less doughy. The Charlie Bowl was the real winner. We mixed up the bowl to allow all of the ingredients to soak in the gravy and WOW! Our taste buds were screaming for joy. The flavor of the gravy was sooo good (not too salty) and the blend of all the ingredients went really well together. I just wish there was a little less biscuit (but that's just my own preference). We finished off our meal with some a bowl of fresh cut fruit, which were absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back to check out their other dishes!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I actually have not visited this location yet but I did visit the location in Victoria BC and the food is absolutely delicious!!   

There will likely be a long line up when you visit and for good reason!!  The food is amazing!!  

The price point is actually spot on for the amount of food that you get!  The portions are massive actually!!  

Well done Jam Cafe!!  You go to the top of my list for amazing breakfast/brunch/lunch in Vancouver!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Really good food and service - I don't know why I can't give this 5-stars, though, but i can't. I could not find anything specifically wrong, aside from it wasn't perfect.

Food: I had the chicken and waffles: really good, but not great
Coffee: really good, but not great.
Service: actually, that was great.
Ambiance: really great, too.

It really comes down to a lot of little things that keep it from perfect, but none of these items are reason not to go. I would go back in a heartbeat. Next time, if the food is better, I would gladly bump this up to perfect."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam is our favorite brunch spot in Vancouver, the food is awesome and it's reasonably priced for the amount you get. We have went back and ordered most items on the menu.
My favorite is the Three Little Pigs which is Pogos but with sausages and pancakes
My fiancée's favorite is between the Farmer's Skillet or Mac N Cheese"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My first trip to Vancouver and I did my homework before coming as I was only here a few days. Jam Cafe on Beatty was a MUST try for breakfast. Be warned, no reservations, first come first serve. We waited 30 minutes in a line that never goes away. But oh man is it worth it!
We opted to sit at the small bar that seats 5 people, I think it's probably the better seats in the tiny place. We were going to get coffee until we spied the drink our neighbors at the bar had. It was a Caesar (Canadian version of a US Bloody Mary) which is made with Clamato and it was AMAZING from the Clamato to the pickled asparagus but the kicker was the thick maple bacon slice they wedge down the inside of glass! I had to order a second one!!!
I am a huge fan of Eggs Benedict and knew I was going to get one of their many options. I decided upon the Pork Belly version. It is an English muffin, caramelized onion jam, tiny bit of bbq sauce at least 1/2"" crispy pork belly, on each muffin too!,I ordered soft poached eggs and added avocado ! It was like a party in my mouth!!! Crunchy, creamy, rich a tiny bit of sweetness from the onion jam and a little tang from the bbq sauce. 
PERFECTION!!!
I am going to have to go back before I leave, and try something new, it's THAT good!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Come here for a wholesome breakfast or brunch. My party of 3 got in line about 10 min before they opened on a Friday and made the cut! Service here is very friendly and speedy despite the instant crowds. I also loved the eclectic interior décor. This is what we ordered:

Large Charlie Bowl: This thing was a monster. It could have really fed 3-4 people even though we meant to share it among 2. Imagine your favorite brunch after thanksgiving plate all mixed into a bowl. This is it. The biscuit dipped in mash potatoes. Bits of meat strewn about. A sunny side egg up top. Delicious. 

Fried Chicken Benedict: After the famous Charlie Bowl, I would say Benedicts are in Jam Cafe's playbook. The egg was perfectly poached and the sauce was rich and creamy. If I came again I would probably try a different protein (the fried chicken was standard and met my expectations but there were so many more options)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited for 30mins,not too bad. There is always a line! Totally worth it! Portion was huge!!! Not kidding a plate can easily feed two people but everything looks yummy, have to order different dishes to taste. We haven't finished all. 

We ordered bloody marry, best one I ever had. Maple syrup glazed beacon in the bloody marry was the highlight. Jammer Mimosa oh so good! Can't stop drinking.              

The Charlie bowl, love gravy on the bread, a lot of hams, bacon chips, hommy food! Pork belly egg Benedict was quite interesting. Not my favorite but the pork belly skin was really crispy. 

Overall it's really good and u must try when u have chance to come to Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been dinning at Jam since they only had the one location in Victoria. Its my FAVOURITE breakfast spot in the city and I definitely don't mind waiting an hour+ for the Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes, they are amazing!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Excellent brunch place! The 4 of us ordered different items and all where A1. The drinks were sensational as well! The lines were long though so be prepared to wait- but its worth it.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I saw this reviewed on the front page of Yelp on June 13, 2016 and decided to book mark this for future reference.

Because they close regularly by 3 pm coordination was a little bit of a challenge and of course it's packed on the weekends.

Because this place has been on my bucket list and it was the rare occasion that I had time to do this.

Before I even stepped in they lost
Points with me. They have the most pretentious and unorganized waiting system. I am sure that this waiting system exists somewhere else in the city, however, this is the first time in 12 years that I've come across it.

There is no wait list. It's first come first serve. You cannot leave the line at all and if you need to leave they will not take a call back number. Very user unfriendly. The host at the door every time I asked about the procedure kept responding with a semi influx tone, ""No you'll just have to wait in line."" It was starting to sound like a bad SNL skit. She seemed semi clueless or at least presented herself that way which just infuriated me that on top of their waiting system they have a door host with what appears to be a lack of confidence in her position. 

They did make an effort to save the day by offering branded umbrellas. This did help with the overall rating in spite of the line situation.

The actual meal itself was amazing.  I had the eggs and beans with a large stack of red velvet pancakes to go. 

Our waiter was awesome."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been to the Jam in Victoria as well as this one. On this particular visit, I ordered a sausage and hash skillet with scrambled eggs and multigrain toast. The skillet was very tasty and filling. The seasoning was perfect, exactly the way I would like a hearty breakfast to taste. The potatoes were crisp and served as a great counter to sausage that can get greasy at times. I also tried the apple cinnamon french toast. It's a tad bit to much syrup, but the taste was awesome. I ordered an alcoholic drink as well, but do not remember the name of it. It tasted good and wasn't skimpy on the alcohol.

We were in line for almost 2 hours before we were seated. We wouldn't have waited that long but when we initially got there, the staff explicitly told my party of 3 that the wait would be around 35 minutes. That turned into 45 minutes 20 minutes after we were told 35. The time kept growing longer and the staff seemed to get much more dodgy. I felt that the people in line were misled on purpose to ensure we stayed. There's no reason to not have a system where you can place a name down and receive a call or text message when the table is ready, especially for such a small establishment where long waits are common. Once we were seated, the service and food came quickly. It surprised me how fast the food came.

The wait was a very negative experience however and would likely stop me from returning if I saw the line. I have to stress that I'm ok with a wait if I have a ballpark estimate of how long it will be, but the constant time revisions and gross misrepresentation of wait time is what turns me off."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We wanted to try the Jam out so we were ok waiting an hour in line outside on the sidewalk on a Friday morning. It was worth it. The food was good, both tasty and excellent presentation. Service was top notch.  The 90s Retro Mimosa was amazing!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There was a long line when we went and my friend went up to get an estimate on how long we'd have to wait. The lady said 15 mins. No way would this line disappear in 15 mins. Not even if they emptied out their entire restaurant. But we stood in line anyways (already paid for parking). It was worth the wait! Total mins: 45 mins.

We were seated at the bar and requested to be switched to a table whenever possible. But apparently that didn't happen. 

We ordered:

Pulled pork pancakes ($16-5/5): Huge portion! Two fluffy pancakes topped with pulled pork, jalapeno sour cream and pickled cabbage. The jalapeno sour cream was amazing. In fact the entire dish was amazing. All the flavours tie it all in together. Would definitely order this again.

Chicken N Waffle ($16-3.5/5): Portion size was slightly small than the pancake but nonetheless still very filling. The gravy made parts of the chicken soggy and the egg yolk wasn't runny when I slice through it. The chicken to waffle ratio was perfect. I felt like there was something missing in flavour. 

Drink:
Pimm's cup ($7-4/5): Not very boozey. Pretty good but not the best I've had. 

Service was alright. Other than the server didn't kept on in mind to seat us at the table when it was available. The wait was a bit long but other than that the food was super good and definitely worth the price we paid."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I couldn't stay away from Jam for long, so I'm back at again for the 3rd time. I can't be stopped.

Mini pro tip:
* Order something sweet to share, and order something from the Sides to share (ie. Chorizo, biscuits 'n gravy, bacon, fried chicken, etc.). It feels like you're eating a balanced meal.

Food:
* Chai Spiced Latté French Toast - it was a daily special, so we jumped on the limited time offer. I was busy talking and eating, so I'm not sure if I tasted all the chai, but it was definitely sweet and moist without any syrup. The whipped cream caught me by surprise, it wasn't heavy, it was lightly sweetened and didn't make me regret my decisions.

* Side of Fried Chicken and Pork Gravy - this mixed with the syrup and sweetness of the French toast made us feel like we were culinary geniuses. The chicken was crisp, not as flavorful as I expected, but I suppose that's what let's the creamy delicious gravy shine. 

* Jam Iced Coffee - I'm not a fan of coffee because I don't know how to appreciate bitterness, but this is sweetened and served in a mason jar. It kept me awake, tasted good, and looked good in photo."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As everyone says, this place is worth the wait. We had an outstanding brunch here on a Tuesday morning. A local suggested I try a Ceaser & I ended up having two! As I looked around at others' meal choices & watched expressions, it was clear that you could not go wrong in terms of entree selection. 
I went with the gravy coops & was more than satisfied. My husband ordered the chicken & waffles which was very good. I just had to try a side portion of the lonely piggy; talk about heaven inside of breading. It's basically a corn dog with sausage inside & is simply fabulous."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's always a good sign when you show up to a breakfast place and it's packed out the door on a Wednesday!

Jam Cafe is truly a breakfast treasure. The space is homey and comfortable, the staff warm and friendly, and the food delicious!

My cousin and I both had the Harrison Salmon Scramble which was utterly divine. Fluffy Scramble eggs with an onion sour cream and smoked salmon served a top a thick piece of multigrain toast alongside an avocado and greens breakfast salad. Such a wonderful meal to start out our first day in Vancouver! 

All the food being ordered around us looked incredible too! There is definitely a commitment to quality and skill in these dishes. 

I would definitely come back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is a genuinely unpretentious, kid friendly restaurant with great service and good food. The servers are attentive and friendly without overdoing it or interrupting our conversation (which is my biggest pet peeves). As soon as we were seated the server brought us kids books. Then we were offered thoughtful solutions to seat our toddler and baby. The baby is allergic to eggs and the server consulted the chef and returned with food recommendation. Although the lineup outside was long (it's a small restaurant), at no time did we feel rushed. They'd happily refill our coffee (bottomless) and didn't bring the bill until we asked for it.  They really wanted their customers to have a good time.

We arrived at 8:30am on a Saturday morning and were seated about an hour later. I had the Charlie bowl - it was as big and as delicious as everyone else said but don't worry, they'd happily pack any leftover for you. One friend had the fried chicken and benedict which he felt was a little dry. Another friend had the gravy coops with buttermilk fried chicken and she liked it.

When we left we were given a postcard and some lollipops. 

Great experience all around."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great range of brunch and breakfast option but the line up is ridiculous! This is a snapshot of our modern Vancouver restaurant scene where we still don't have enough cool places for all to be able to enjoy a relaxing comfortable setting without the line up, and some of us seem to be completely ok with standing out in the rain for the simple act of eating a high quality meal!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"WHAT even IS this place!
There's a line out the door all day long, so get there around 20-30 mins before they open, it is worth it, let me tell you!

Trendy newer place that's taken up a small space to do breakfast and to do it RIGHT. We were starving, hungover, and barely alive on the second day of our trip to Vancouver, and this place brought us back to life.

First, there was the coffee. Which, you know, was black coffee brewed in back. Nice and strong, it did the trick fine. Then came my wife's Caesar (which, for the layperson, is a Bloody Mary with Clamato in it, a Vancouver staple) which she LOVED

Then, came the food. This was our first introduction to ""Canada Portions,"" and on our new campaign to split meals so we can spend less and try more places, we split a full order of the veggie hash/bowl/something. The Charlie? When it came out, we were actually dumbfounded. It was literally the size of a basketball. And MAN was it good!
We stuffed our faces well beyond reason, and we were hungry, and we still only got halfway through the thing. So, lunch too, right?
We also scoped out our neighbors food to either side (seating is a little tight), and found the sizes to be similar - the French Toast, for example, is a mountain of I believe six pieces of toast, each one almost two inches thick, and resting in rolling hills of whipped cream. 

Aside from the food, the service was top notch, and the music and decor were a lot of fun, they went a long way towards making this the perfect breakfast joint.

Seriously, if you really mean it about breakfast/brunch this is the spot."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm going to say that I likely just had a unique poor experience here? I mean, there ought to be a reason why there is consistently a 30+minute wait to get a seat! This is what I experienced, however...


FOOD/DRINK:  29/50

We started out with a strawberry milkshake which was unfortunately the highlight of the meal. It was indeed one of the best milkshakes I've ever had. Good value; perfect thick ice cream, lovingly garnished with a yummy gold berry. It's as good as it looks!

Sadly, it went downhill from there, as my farmhouse breakfast skillet was dry and my friend's Huevos Rancheros was BEAN CITY (the black beans violently overpowered all of the other delicious aspects of the dish). Flavour profiles of both plates were great, but had enough ""off"" about them that made for an unlikely disappointing experience. The people sitting beside us also sent back their cold hash browns. What can I say? Can't win em' all!


SERVICE/SUPPORT STAFF:  22/30

The service was friendly, yet I didn't really know who my server was, as multiple girls were coming to our table to take care of us. I didn't feel special being there, as they probably see 300+ faces/day. I was just another guest to them which made me feel a little taken for granted from my guest perspective. There was nothing personable about my Jam experience. Other than that, they were efficient, did water top-ups and even quality checks. I neglected to express my meal issue, as I kept thinking, ""Oh, that bite was okay, maybe the rest will be better,"" so you don't say anything. Has that ever happened to you? Partly my bad, but on hind site, wish I had of been more honest about my experience. I think they would have appreciated it.

ENVIRONMENT/VIBE:  16/20

Come prepared to wait AT LEAST 30 minutes to get in here. Their wait times are often well over an hour. Why? Because it's a hip, cute spot with (apparently) the best breakfast food in Vancouver. The inside is silly and cozy all at the same time. They're doing a lot of things right here in my books.


OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  67/100

Next time I have a few hours to spend, I'll be back to try a different dish! Cheers."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As I told my friend Winnie once, the only time I don't want to go for brunch is in my sleep and even then I'm dreaming about brunch so I was extremely excited to hear that Jam Cafe was opening in Gastown. I've tried a handful of brunch places in Vancouver and none of them have been special enough that I would call it my ""favourite"" brunch place.

I went on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't super packed but still busy enough that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The interior of the store has that rustic, antique hipster look that really fits the Gastown vibe. I love the old-school cameras!

My mom and I were both feeling the eggs benedict and at first bite I'd fallen in love with the Hollandaise sauce.

Here's what we ordered:
Fried Chicken Eggs Benny - Buttermilk fried chicken topped with roasted corn salsa (3.5/5). In my opinion the chicken was a little bit dry and more hollandaise sauce would've tasted better, but my mom really enjoyed this one!

Pork Belly Eggs Benny - Roasted pork belly w/onions topped with BBQ sauce (4.5/5) - oh my god this was so good. I really like Asian style pork belly and the last time I got pork belly at a Western restaurant I was so disappointed, but this was delicious! The skin was the right level of crunchiness and the meat was delicious. There was also a layer of caramelized onions (they call it onion jam in their menu) which complemented the dish very well, even though I don't normally like onions.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Jam Cafe and look forward to returning so I can try more of their dishes!

Service: 5/5 - everyone was very friendly and attentive!

Ambiance: 4/5 - it was a little bit loud but I just love the interior design so much!

Food: 4/5

Would I return: yes"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing food and service!! Well worth the wait!! Caesar's are dangerously good! Had the hash with tots and my wife the fried chicken blu cheese sandwich, both Devine!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place was so good!! My friend and I waited in line for about 20 minutes on a mid-morning Wednesday. I ordered the chicken french toast and my friend ordered the chicken and waffles. We both really enjoyed our dishes. We ordered the rose all day and a mimosa, and while both drinks were kind of weak, they were refreshing. Our server was attentive and it was overall very pleasant vibes. I will definitely be back when in Vancouver.

I would recommend that you GO!! - just get there early so you may not have to wait very long."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I wish there was a button to give a 3.5 star review because I don't think they deserve a 3, but they also don't deserve a 4. 

We waited half an hour to be seated on a Saturday. I have zero complaints when it comes to waits, but if I'm waiting I expect the food to be worth the wait. Their menu was large and there's choices for everyone. I took about seven other people there and they all found their match on the menu. Unfortunately, only two of them were actually satisfied with the food. 

I ended up getting a French toast sandwich type thing with Nutella and bananas on the inside. It's called the Cracker Jack, and it was dry and burnt on parts. They had a great idea, but it would have tasted 10x better if the bread was soaked longer prior to being cooked. They put hardly any Nutella on it, and this disappointed the hell out of me. The fruit salad was the best part of the plate. 

As a side item I got the grapefruit brûlée. Don't get it, it's not worth it. I would rather have a fresh grapefruit. 

I don't think this place is worth the wait. If it was a quick in and out I would be happier, but I prefer better food if I'm waiting. Clever menu, and maybe people who's pallet isn't as developed would like it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came by one week after opening and boy oh boy, it was amazing. since it was a thursday at 9:30, there was no wait and we very slowly chose the little charlie and fried chicken eggs benedict.

both were absolutely delicious with shredded and pan fried hash browns that were hearty but not oily (theres a big difference). the eggs were a touch over medium but the fried chicken was perfect. nice thick slabs of breast with minimal and not overly seasoned breading with a light but adequate drizzle of hollandaise and tangy corn salsa, this was my preferred dish. 

the little charlie bowl was in fact not little at all (we didn't make it to half) but it was also great. their gravy goes perfect with more of their hash browns and biscuits. with chunks of cheese, ham and sunny side eggs on top, this was an extremely filling bowl but i just kept digging in. 

service was also extremely friendly and helpful with the atmosphere being lively and not pretentious at all (sorry catch 122). overall, huge portions for a great price and an even better taste."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place left a bad taste in my mouth!

All throughout our trip to Vancouver, (my first time) my friend and I kept repeating to each other how incredibly nice the people of this lovely city is, well at least until today, where I encountered an extremely brash and rude hostess.

As she made her way back up the line after taking a head count, I asked how long the wait may be. This was our last day in Vancouver and our air bnb host made this recommendation and we wanted to grab brunch before heading to the sky train. She proceeded to answer my question dismissively and even walked away as I continued to talk to her. Ok.

One hour goes by and I to approached the hostess again about how much longer the wait may be and she became down right rude and obnoxious! I think the standard answer they give about the wait is 30-45mins but when in reality its more like 1.5-2hrs!

Needless to say, at that point my friend and I stepped out of line and walk right over to the adjacent restaurant where we were seated right away and enjoyed a delicious meal!

Bye Jam Bye! More than plenty of good af brunch spots in the good ol'US!!! 

**From the looks of it, other reviewers seems to agree about the rude staff!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfast places in Vancouver. Originally from Victoria, they opened up one in Vancouver. 
Everything is great on the menu. But keep in mind if you are going expect a line up. There always is, so don't be discourage or hangry. It's well worth the wait. 
It can get noisy at times but the staff are very friendly and the food is great. Wait time for food once ordered is not too bad either. 
A must try."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This is my favorite place for brunch. Great food (try their blueberry jam on French toast) great atmosphere and great service. They open at 8:00 am and there are people queuing 45 minutes before they open (even in the rain) for space is limited. I will always stop by here each time I visit Vancouver.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Maybe it was what we ordered? Maybe it was the awfully long wait (more than an hour on a Monday!) but it was a little underwhelming. Service was good however. We sat at the bar and even though he was busy, our server was attentive.

Their pancakes look better than their waffles tasted. Waffles were a bit too dense and chewy for me. Not quite what I like. The maple butter however is delish! 

The eggs were tasty and cooked just right, the bread (dark rye) and jam was very more-ish, and the avo was perfectly ripe! Hash browns were good too. 

My friend ordered the eggs benny but was so turned off by the wait that she made no comment on the food. Although I will say that one of the couples who sat next to us at the bar ordered the bacon Benny and was very pleased with it ‍"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came to Jam Cafe for brunch on my birthday and it was definitely a great start on the day. The staff are very friendly, they got us in 10 minutes before closing and were very patient with our large group. I got the buffalo blue sandwich which contains crispy buffalo chicken breast. The chicken was really juicy and filled with so much flavor, tastefully complementing it's soft and crunchy bun. 

I got the house salad as a side. It comes in a cute small bowl, great portion control by the way. The salad is dressed with vinegar and topped off with banana peppers, garbanzo beans and kidney beans."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Overrated and ordinary. No idea where the other reviews are coming from. Line up for bad coffee and ordinary overpriced food?? No thank, never again. 
Do yourself a favor, read this review while you're standing in line on Beatty St. - close the Yelp app, open maps instead and punch in Cafe Medina....then RUN there."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm always fine waiting as long as food is good. 3 stars is disregarding the fact that we waited in line for a long time. Strictly food.

We ordered 3 dishes. Red velvet pancakes, the charlie bowl, and the cracker jack.
And caramel lattes.

Coffee-foam was too bubbly...like something you can make at home with home froather. One of the worst lattes in Vancouver I've tasted.

Red velvet-I like fluffy pancakes and this was not one of those. My husband and I each ate a piece and we never took a second bite.

The charlie bowl-this was ok, could have been better if my over easy eggs were not ""over hard""

The cracker jack-very dry brioche, just tasted like nutella and banana. Dish started woozying out water after about ten mins.

Bottom line-we only ate maybe a third of what we ordered, would not be visiting back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Hidden Gem for breakfast/brunch!!! When you want to treat yourself to something decadent you must go to Jam Cafe.  Everything on the menu is WOW!!! Try the red velvet pancake ;) we also shared the fried chicken benedict with side hollandaise!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We waited awhile. Sucks they don't have a text option. But the worth was definitely worth it. The portions are very large so filling !! The waffles are a must. I recommend there vegetarian bowl it was good!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe, most of the time you will see a long line up outside, that make people more curious about their food, guessing it must be really tasted. But, I'd say good value and good service and good atmosphere, but not my first option for brunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Apparently, there is always a line for this place! Glad I could come early and beat it. Still the place was buzzing. The staff were great! The food was just wonderful! Never enjoyed brunch that much in my life! Definitely will be coming here more often! Definitely understand the line now!

Also reason I have given 4 stars instead of 5 is because the place can feel a little packed and tight. I wish I had a little bit more room to enjoy my food.

Food 10/10
Ambiance 9/10
Staff 10/10"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yes there's a line!!! Reviewers stops telling us the same thing everyone has said a million times. 

With that said, I got here around 10:15am and there was a long line. Can you believe that? Finally got in around 11:15am.

I ordered the Gravy coop with chicken and the pork belly on the side. The pork belly was disappointing. It was over fried and not tender enough.  

As for my main entree, I will have to say it was very well cooked and prepared. My complaint and my enjoyment of the dish is awkwardly one in the same. The plate was very linear in taste, in that flavors were not bold, and it made the entire experience cohesive in that respect.  However, it also made the plate kinda of boring as well.  

Overall, if you don't mind waiting for an hour I would say you should definitely try this place out. Their cooking swag is unique and any foodie, would at the very least, appreciate that aspect of their meal."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great food options and nice decor. Lots of selection for vegetarians and tons of sides. Prices aren't bad.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Every single time I go here I'm always impressed with my food. The Charlie bowl is hands down the winner winner chicken dinner. Service is great each time. Everyone knows what they're doing. GO if you haven't.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Having seen long lines every time we went past this place we were looking forward to try the food here, so finally we decided to wake up early in the morning and stand in line outside at 7:45. The plan worked and we were able to get a seat at 8 when the cafe opened. 
We were really excited to try the food and ordered a charlie bowl and chicken and french toast. To be frank they were just ok nothing life changing. We felt that the food was just large portion sizes with ampedup  calorie count (which might be one of the reason for it's popularity). It didn't have a wow factor for us. We felt that the food was hyped and not worth the long lines. We have also had breakfast at chambar which is right next door, which we enjoyed far more than what we had here.If you care about large portion sizes than you might enjoy it but for us flavor is more important.  We might one day decide to give this place another go but the first experience was disappointing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came with a group of friends and as expected we had to wait at least an hour to get in. The food was worth the wait. 

I really appreciated the customer service at Jam Cafe. They are very friendly. Also, while waiting in line, they will usually give you waffles to try which were great. Except it only made you want to get in faster and eat everything. 

We had ordered the red velvet pancakes to share and I had the Charlie bowl (regular size) with chorizo on the side.

The serving size at this place are huge and you'll be sure to leave feeling full-you get great value. 
The pancakes were delicious. It was nice and moist. The triple stack is big enough to share with a group of 4. The Charlie bowl was yummy. It's packed with hash brown, biscuit, diced ham, topped with eggs, and covered in gravy.  It's large enough to share with people and eating it on your own (which I did) can be quite challenging. The chorizo is made in house. It had a nice flavor but it was a bit too tough for me.

I had a great experience at Jam. I was lucky to try a little bit of the other dishes from my friends as they were all yummy. I definitely recommend it to others. But be prepared to wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"NOOOO! Did not deliver...the star rating is a lie! 

We were visiting from out of town and looking for good local brunch. We thought this HAD to be the place because of the reviews and the extremely long line of people outside. After a very long wait, we ordered:

Cracker Jack
Chicken n Waffles 
Triple Stack Pancakes 
Hash browns 
Avocado toast 

ALL of our food was served cold-lukewarm! Nothing was served hot :/

Personally, I prefer my food to taste hot & fresh. I do not like my food room temperature. On top of the temperature of the food, it tasted mediocre at best. I've had very good brunch and this place failed to deliver. 

For drinks we ordered passion fruit lemonade & orange juice, which were the best items we tasted at Jam Cafe."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I just don't think it's worth the wait! This was my second time at Jam and at 7:30am on a Thursday morning there were 19 people already lined up at the door! I repeat 19 people! Not to mention the line that formed after me. Prior to doors opening the tables were already full with the 30+ people in line. I bought a Tim Hortons coffee for the line as i arrived earlier than my friends, I wasn't able to bring the rest of my coffee into the restaurant as there's no outside food or bev allowed inside but I needed it for the lineup I just waited in, the least I could be awarded was to finish my coffee. Also at 8am i need triple coffees so it wouldn't have even stopped me from purchasing an in-house coffee if that's what they're worried about. Any who, onto the main act, we got a table and placed our orders - I got a coffee and the half order smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The half order is $13 and the full order is $16 which doesn't make any sense, if it's a half order charge half the full price value at $8. I'm paying $13 for a half an English muffin, a piece of smoked salmon, one egg and hollandaise with a hash-brown patty? The mark up is high. It tasted great but still not worth the price. We were also apparently the last table to order during the rush so our food took 45 minutes to arrive to our table. I truly am baffled why this joint is as popular as it is? The service was great, all the ladies working the floor were attentive and know how to handle the big crowds. If you're okay with paying $15+ for breakfast and waiting for yummy food, this is a good spot for you. I gotta say though, Chambar serves an incredible breakfast with zero line and it's right next door! Also you can make resos which is a bonus. Bye Jam, no more lines for me!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Worth the long wait. Food was spot on with great service . If your favorite meal is breakfast eating here will make you think you died and went to heaven.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Got lunch here one day and when I tasted it I understood the hype. If you can go at a time when the queues aren't too long I'd definitely recommend it.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Really good food but the line is not worth it in my opinion. I wish they would do a reservation system cause I would go so much more but chamber is next door and you can reserve....
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've seen and heard many great things about Jam Cafe. This place is right by the Stadium-Chinatown skytrain stop and it is on the same block as Chambar. We arrived here on a Sunday at 10:50am for Brunch and the line had about 30+ people in front of us. We didn't get seated for another 1 hour and 40 mins (at least, it may have been 1 hour and 50 mins). They do offer you samples of their waffles while you are waiting which was nice. 

Their food is really unique and they have different types of mixtures of breakfast/lunch items that you won't find anywhere else. I had the Breakfast Farmer Skillet while my friends ordered the Chicken and Waffles, Charlie Bowl and a full order of Red Velvet Pancakes (comes with 3 large pancakes). My skillet was tasty and flavourful. The red velvet pancakes have cream cheese icing on the top pancake. Once you eat the top pancake, there would be barely any cream cheese left once you dig in. Overall, the food was different and I didn't find much wrong with the food. 

I just could not get over the wait time. Waiting for almost 2 hours is quite a while and I get that this place is very popular but I can't justify standing in line for that long. One more thing I noticed was that when we were paying by credit card, on the tip machine, when you click % for tip, although I've never seen this before, they may have it at other restaurants, but 20% was option 1 and then 18% as option 2 and 15% as option 3. Usually, the tip options are ascending... I thought this was very strange but I guess most people will click the top option first as default so they are hoping to get 20% tips by default? Hmm.."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"OMG... They deserve 10-Stars. Everything was amazing, the coffee, the food. I cannot really find words the flavor of the food & coffee, aside from F-AH-MAZING. The biscuits they have there are the best I've had in my life, with no aftertaste."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As others have mentioned, there is a long wait. But the food and service is worth it. 

- Food is delicious and portions are huge!  

- Anything with fried chicken is a good choice for first timers. 

- Service is awesome.

- We got here at 9:30am and waited 1 hour for a table for 4.

- Charlie bowls are huge!  The size of the mini is what I expected a regular bowl to be."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Really long lines but the food was worth all the wait. The service was great and they were always willing to help. The burger and Mac and cheese was amazing. They way they caramelize the bacon was amazing. Great twists on American food with a Canadian twist. The portions were huge but after the long wait you will finish it all. Stay warm if you decide to go in the winter.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Everything we've ordered here has been delicious. It is extremely popular, so if you don't want to stand in a ginormous line (although it is worth it), show up early--20 minutes before they open!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I was really impressed by the service when i went here. It just made the experience that much better than i expected. The staff were just super professional and efficient. The food was good too. I tried the chicken and waffles, and they were ok... not bad at all, i just feel like i've had better. I'd still go back to try other dishes"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The chicken waffles are so good here! Chicken is crispy, and well seasoned. Bacon is the best! I don't normally eat bacon, but they make the best with proper amount of sweetness and texture. Pork belly benny is what couple of my friends' usual order."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really liked this place!  You get giant food for your money!  I got the vegetarian breakfast bowl and 1 red velvet pancake.  Honestly I was more interested in the pancake, so I put my efforts towards that and ate about a quarter of the breakfast bowl.  I took the leftovers with me and there was so much leftover my boyfriend and I bout had a plateful for lunch later!

We tried to go on Saturday and arrived a little after 9 and there was a line it would have taken us at least an hour to get through.  We came again on a Sunday and arrived at 8:02 (they open at 8) and the restaurant was already full.  We waited the half hour to get in to try it.

The food was delicious and unique, would definitely go back and try something else!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic food !! One of the best brunch places we have visited recently. We ordered a veggie bowl, biscuit and eggs and a red velvet pancake. The veggie bowl was excellent - biscuit, hash browns and mushroom gravy (what's not to like), I would say that the quantities are huge. The red velvet pancake was a delight though I would have preferred it a bit less sweet

Wait time - 30 min but worth it !

(Veggie guy)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam cafe is always a difficult experience for me. I've done it a couple times now and the food is always solid, but good GOD the wait is just insane. No food is worth waiting 45 minutes for, not even those chicken waffles."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I am vising so I'm a tourist. Good thing my partner told me to drive instead of walking which will take us 30 min or one hour to walk. The map took us to a different directions which but we finally found the place and saw there was a ling line but looking at the website and on the Yelp reviews on this site it did not say you'll be greeted with a long  line which irritated me already. If your a tourist and don't  have time skip this one even if the reviews looks good instead go to Chambers. I don't like places which you have to wait in line especially if your in a time crunch or been walking around just to find this place, please!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Big portions to me but the food isn't what it's hyped up to be. I've been passing by this place for months and always saw that the place always had a lineup so I thought I'd come check it out with my wife. 

After seeing the posts of the Charlie Bowl, I decided to give it a try. The bowl is good but the diabetes special bacon ruined it for me. It was just way too sweet. 

My daughter ordered the bacon, eggs, and toast and was surprised to see my daughter actually say she didn't want to eat bacon when she loves having bacon for breakfast. 

Will I be back? Nope.....I'd rather go to Jethro's since its just down the block from me and I don't want to waste my time lining up for below mediocre food."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Be prepared for a bit of a wait but worth it for great food and cool vibe! Bacon Eggs Benedict was yummy. London Fog was on point. Small location, table are a bit close. Don't come looking for a quiet, private spot but nice chill spot."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ordered tater bowl and single stack of pancake. Tater bowl is definitely special and unique. It has tater tots, eggs, corn, cheeses, pulled pork, chimicurri sauce, and the combination is heavenly. Tater bowl is new on the menu. Thanks to our waitress Benita for the recommendation. The pancake, we ordered red velvet pancake. The pancake tastes perfect! I can taste the chocolate in it, and it's not too sweet. The pancake texture is soft and pillowy. This place is definitely a special finding!

Excellent service definitely also. Benita is the best! Her recommendation is spot on. She brought books for the kids while we're waiting. Very attentive! Worth the wait! Will come wherever I see Jam cafe!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Had breakfast here 4 times while visiting Vancouver for a week. Had eggs Benedict twice (once with salmon, once with fried chicken), pancakes and yogurt parfait. Bennies are amazing, if I'd more days I'd tried the other versions. Pancakes were not great, dry and with blueberry jam instead of fresh blue berries. Yogurt parfait is a big and satisfying bowl with fruit, granola and the awesome cinnamon spiced honey. 
Staff is great and attentive even when it is busy. I came early all the days and was able to be seated straight away 3 out of the 4 times, but later on waits are long."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"OMG!!! My family and I came here on the last day of our short trip. OMG!! It was sooooo good. First thing you need to know is that the line is down the street, which makes sense because of how good it is. The food was amazing and all the staff was friendly, but ANDREA was the nicest ever! She was so helpful and showed great customer service (I would pull her to work for my company, but I don't live there)!! You do get a lot of food, so I would recommend maybe splitting one of the bowls with something sweet, like a pancake, french toast or waffle. Best breakfast in town!!!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"What the hell, there was a line even on a Monday morning. 

I teetered between the Gravy Coup and the Little Charlie. I thought the Gravy Coup (fried chicken on a biscuit with hash browns) sounded too filling so I opted for the lesser fare. 
Egg on my face! 
When they brought out the Little Charlie I laughed nervously and asked, "" Are you sure this isn't the Big Charlie?"". She looked at me with pity and smiled politely at my ignorance.
It looked like a day after Thanksgiving lunchbox. Everything (hash browns, broken up biscuit, gravy, ham, onions and 2 huge sunny side ups) was piled in a bowl the size of my face.  It was good, but it was too much too soon. I barely ate half of it. 
It's probably enough for 2 to share. 
What's not enough to share? The pork belly benedict because my guy hogged it to himself.  Selfish bastard. It was apparently so good he unintentionally made indecent facial expressions from first to last bite. Annoying.

Ok, I lied. He did give me a bite, but I saved it as my last bite because I wanted my meal to end on a note that would elicit a similar facial expression to his.  

It was indeed oh my goodness delicious. 
Get the pork belly benedict."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There was a line out the door first thing in the morning and it became evident the reputation of Jam Cafe was well earned.  I wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on an amazing egg dish that I cannot even describe.  The pickled onions got me to order the dish and I am so happy I did.  It was a wonderful combination of flavors that all worked and satisfied each of my taste needs.  

Others had pancakes, which were stunning to look at and received an equally positive reaction, and some more traditional breakfast items.  The variety of Mimosa's were also fun.  If I am ever in town again, I will be planning a return visit to the Jam Cafe for sure!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Super-upper-duper long wait, but you think the line is worth it. We waited about an hour. It was okay, but not worth an hour (check out Catch-22, instead). The service was very friendly, we had a great waitress (Amity), but the pancakes were only so-so and my companions soup was undercooked."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing food with great service! The wait can be really long but it's worth the wait. I got the little Charlie bowl and by no means was it little! 
Pro tip- Go solo and you may be able to skip the line if they have any open spots at the counter. I was in and out in less than an hour on a Saturday!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The long waits for mediocre food. 
Shitty waitress ( maybe she was having a bad day) 
Took them 20 min to bring our drinks as well as I asked for a pickle for my  ceaser which took another 20 min no joke.
Ordered the Charlie bowl  which was a bit dry, asked for a little bit more gravy to put on it and she brought it to see on my bill I was charged 3.65 for a tbls if gravy and guess what even charged me .50 for a slice of pickle. 
Seriously ?  It was basically the same service as asking McDonald's for extra sauce and they look at you like you're asking for their kidney. 
I only tipped 10% which it would've been higher if they weren't so cheap with the spoonful of gravely and pickle !!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Seriously there's no reason not to have breakfast here at least once. 
Yes, the line is long, but it's worth it. 

Don't worry they're looking for a second location.. hopefully in east van ( fingers crossed). The second location will help with the line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This is probably the only brunch I think is worth the wait. The Best huevos rancheros you will ever have. Even better than The ones I tried in Mexico. Insiders tip is to go to the newer location in kits because it's bigger so the lineup moves faster.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Tried coming here literally right before closing and the line was around the block! So ended up trying again the next morning and got here right around opening and was SHOCKED to be seated in the first round of tables. We got quite a few dishes, dutch baby pancake, farmers skillet, and a biscuit- everything with so good and all the tables around us that ordered something different looked amazing too! 

Come here! But be prepared to wait, and if you can get here before opening- totally worth it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fabulous every time. Highly recommend.
It's a great place to go with a handful of friends and order as many plates as possible to share!
You'll go home with your food smelling like food but small price to pay for a delicious meal."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is by far the best breakfast I've had ANYWHERE EVER. The long wait is extremely worth it. The old fashioned breakfast was my favorite and we went twice in our 4 day stay in Vancouver. The biscuits are incredible I suggest getting some to go too.

The service was excellent too. The staff acknowledged the wait was very long and did their best to make everybody happy. Highly recommend this place for breakfast and/or brunch... Just make sure to go early."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Word is - Jam Cafe is THE spot to get brunch in Vancouver, and it appears to be so with the line outside the door every weekend.  The first time I spotted this place was when I went next door to Chambar a few years ago, and wondered what the line was for.  And since then I never made it to Jam Cafe because the long line always turned me off.  

But in my most recent trip to Vancouver, my friend and I decided to finally make it happen.  The night before we looked up what time it opens (8AM), and made it a plan to get there, right at opening despite how hungover we knew we'd be.  We walked from our hotel on Robson Street, which was a five-minute walk to here and arrived right at eight, and guess what?  There was already a line!  Though once we got in line and were number four on the list, we waited for an hour to finally get inside!  So apparently, people wait in line even before Jam Cafe opens.  One of the employees would walk outside every now and then and would get the quantity of each party and take any coffee orders while we waited.  She mentioned that since there were so many people who formed a line before it opened - they filled every seat inside which is why even when you get here at opening there will be a wait.  Good to know.  

When my friend and I finally made it inside we were beyond gleeful.  We finally could sit down.  Everything on the menu looked so, so good.  Truly.  Even though an hour wait was the perfect time to browse the menu prior to getting inside and deciding on what we'd want, my friend and I still needed a minute or so to finalize our decision.  I ended up getting the Gravy Coupe with a side of a Red Velvet Pancake.  

Despite how crazy busy the place was our server was super friendly and patient, and the food came out quicker than expected.  The food looked delicious and the patrons sitting at the table next to us, admitted that after seeing our plates, there may be some game changers.  There's nothing like fried chicken with a biscuit, slathered with gravy for me, which is why I went with the Gravy Coupe.  And just because red velvet pancakes isn't something you can get just anywhere I ordered a side of that, which was a brilliant choice.   The Gravy Coupe was good; and liked that though it sounds heavy, it surprisingly, wasn't salty or so overly filling that you feel sick eating it.  The chicken was tender and had a nice crispy batter on it from the corn flour and liked that the fried eggs still had a runny yolk once you cut into them.  The biscuit was soft and a big portion, which I ended up not finishing.  And I liked that the gravy was the right amount, as it did not ruin or overtake the different flavors from the rest of the entree.  Also, if you're a spice fan - instead of Tabasco for the grub, Jam makes their own jalapeno hot sauce, which was killer.  It's on every table, so it's worth a try.  Overall, the Gravy Coupe was a good plate, and would recommend for anyone who enjoys chicken and biscuits.  But I have to say the side of the red velvet pancake was better!  It had a lot of that red velvet/chocolate-y flavor with a drizzle of cream cheese frosting and powdered sugar.  A side/one pancake was by far enough, and can't imagine how anyone can eat a stack/entree of them, which includes three pancakes.  The pancake was definitely more so a dessert item, so will be easy to share with someone else, since the red velvet flavor was so distinct and bold.  Noms.  

I guess the better question is - would I wait in line an hour again for Jam Cafe?  Probably not.  Jam Cafe is a wonderful breakfast and brunch spot and would advise anyone who hasn't before to get it on, but after trying it out, I can't say it was worth the hour wait.  30 minutes, sure.  But an hour is pushing it.  Maybe ask me again once Jam Cafe does delivery to Seattle though.  Now that would be a game changer."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We were vacationing and stayed nearby and noticed that the line to this place was down the street several days in a row while we were there. So we decided we had to check it out.

There is a reason why this place had a line down the street every day...even during the work week. They have some great food and the portions were pretty big...actually who am i kidding, they were large, i only ate most of mine because I was pregnant at the time.

They have some fantastic brunch items - I ordered the chicken and waffles, my husband ordered the gravy coops. I really enjoyed the chicken, savory and extra crispy; waffle was fluffy and stood up to the chicken/gravy mix. And the gravy was a nice sausage gravy, not too thick, although I could have used just a little more of it. I know my husband enjoyed his dish, the biscuit was gigantic, and was pretty delicious.

I would definitely suggest checking this place out, arrive early so you don't end up waiting in the line!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you're a carb loving brunch fan, this is the place for you. A few visits in & I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy. Particularly the chicken & waffles, the Three Pigs (with their own version of a corndog) & the pulled pork pancakes.

Only issue is definitely the line ups that never end. I understand the convenience of first come first served, but with the popularity of this brunch spot, I really feel that a reservation system would be a great idea. Tie a reservation to a credit card to ensure you reduce the amounts of ""no shows"". 

I love trying to take out of town guests to this spot, but I haven't always been successful, as the line ups do scare us off. But when you do get a seat, it's a nice, comfortable meal & the staff definitely don't try to rush you out to fit in another cover."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is so bomb, so yummy. Be prepared to wait in line because it's seriously long! Very comfortable ambiance.

Portions are fairly big to share. I ordered the Chicken and waffles with Iced coffee, which was a good balance of sweets and savoury. It also comes with eggs!! The chicken was so tender and flavourful, perfect to go along with the waffle. 

The only downside I felt was their Iced coffee... It consisted of mostly milk and lacked any taste of coffee. And when the ice melted, it was basically a cup of milk water... However, the staff was superb and energetic, they're very willing to help you describe the dishes you are craving for. 

Will definitely come back if I find the willpower to wait in very long line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We ordered the famous Chicken & Waffle but the waffle was totally burned. Not tasty at all. We ended up not even finishing them. I am a little disappointed. The chicken tastes good, but I have had better fried chicken elsewhere. The corn bread was really tasty though. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend you to give it a try.

As a lot of other popular brunch places, Jam Cafe has a long line, so better bring your cellphone and fully charge it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you are visiting from out of town, Jam Cafe is a must in Vancouver! I waited around an hour to eat here and it was worth! Got the fried chicken with French toast and it was so tasty and flavorful. Next time I come will for sure be in line before they open. Thanks for great service and an overall great experience!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Totally worth the wait! But visit on a weekday to avoid super long line. 

The portion sizes at Jam cafe is pretty amazing and they are definitely delicious . I recommend their fried chicken dishes as well as their waffles are pretty good . 

Given the long lines their service is prompt and friendly . Must eat in Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was beyond excited to try this place after reading so many great reviews and looking at all the amazing pictures. Was packed when we got there. I opened the door and was ""greeted"" by a girl who instantly grabbed the door handle like she was going to shut it. I said ""can you tell me how long the wait might be"". She glanced at me (no smile) and curtly said ""I'll talk to you in a minute"" turned away from me and called in a party of 6. 
I am sad that I will not get to try this place until I am sure the customer service (at the door) is improved."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long wait times for this cool breakfast/brunch spot, but good things come to those that wait. The food is phenomenal and at a super affordable price. Also, the portion sizes are huge so you will not be disappointed if you decide to stop in."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe blew me away. It was one of the best brunches I've had in my life. As a brunch enthusiast, this was flippin' awesome!!! H and I went on a weekday at 11:30am, there was still a line. This is how popular this place is hahaha. However, the line moved fairly fast and we got in there in about 20 min. 

The place is super rustic and laidback. The food came pretty slowly but it was somewhat understandable as they are ridiculously busy all the time. The payoff is incREDIBLE though - I took one bite of my food and left this earth and went to brunch heaven. 

I got a veggie bowl, the vegetarian version of the famous Charlie Bowl and oh my gosh, my mouth is watering as I write this because it was so perfect. Hash on the bottom, eggs on top, and mushrooms and a bunch of cheese in between. The butter biscuits killed me. H got Huevos Rancheros and those refried beans were the best I've ever had. They were bursting with flavor. 

Everything was super on point and it is NOT overhyped at all, it deserves all the hype, ever. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. 

Highly recommend, will go back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We've tried on several occasions to go to Jam Cafe and the lines were always very long. However, 3rd times a charm and we were seated after a ""reasonable"" 30 minute wait.

The hype is real. Staff is super attentive, the food is delicious, and the portions are large. We had the charlie bowl, gravy coop, and some waffles. I ate so much I couldn't eat lunch. Enjoy!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is apparently a must visit place in vancouver, whether you are visiting or living here. You would do yourself a favor though by trying this on a weekday, when the queues are a lot shorter. 
It does live up to the hype. Food looks good and tastes good. Service is good too and they don't rush you even with all those people waiting outside."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We visited Jam Café for breakfast one day and loved it so much, we returned the next day for breakfast, too (despite our wanting to try out as many different places as possible!). That speaks volumes (if you know us!).

After reading the Yelp reviews, I expected to wait. But we were pleasantly surprised: the first day, we were seated right away (we got one of the last available tables, though) and the next, we had our choice of tables as the restaurant was about 2/3 full. Both mornings, we were there at 8:15am the first day and at 8:30am the next. 

The food is amazing here. The oatmeal is unreal, with blueberry jam and lemon curd, grilled or fried in a skillet. We had that twice. Had an omelet one day; it was excellent. And had the smoked salmon eggs benedict which was divine. 

We marveled at some of the dishes served to folks at neighboring tables. The red velvet pancakes are obscenely humongous and decadent and the couple oohed and aahed and took photos of this mountain of decadence before digging in to it (they ended up boxing half the meal to take home. It was that huge). Other tables got mountains of food, too. I'm talking MOUNTAINS. So beware, some meals are incredibly humongous. 

Servers are all attentive and friendly, and prices are reasonable We thought the coffee was good, and the restaurant décor was country-cute (with a Canadian hipster flair!). Loved the lollipops handed out with the bill. 

All in all, this is one of our favorite breakfast spots in Vancouver. Looking forward to returning again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great food and friendly wait staff! Waited about 40 minutes to get brunch since they don't take reservations but it was definitely worth it! The sweet potato fries are to die for. Food size portions are more than generous and prices are very good too! We had the Turkey Lurkey sandwich and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! Great balance of flavors. Definitely recommend this place to all brunch go-ers!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Are the lines really worth the wait? Short answer: probably.  The food is all unbelievably tempting, there's something for everyone.  Portions are huge and it's the ultimate comfort food.

If you're going to go, either go super early to wait in line before it opens, or go late in the day when the lines have died down (1:30/2), OR grab a big coffee, and bring someone along who is patient and who's company you don't mind being in for over an hour! (Dress for the weather and you're good!)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been wanting to try Jam Cafe for a few years now, but never had the chance until yesterday. So apparently there's a wait even on weekdays... we arrived around 11am and were seated about 50 minutes later. My sister was like, ""don't people have work or school??"" haha. The long wait made us hungry, so we were excited to dig in!

- Charlie Bowl: this was non-negotiable, because it is one of the most popular items on the menu, and for good reason. I really, really enjoyed this! There were so many textures happening in a single bowl, from the sunny-side up egg to the meats and the grain base. The peas also did some magic (it's amazing the difference a single ingredient can make!), and it almost reminded me of fried rice, even though there is absolutely no rice in this (just hash browns and biscuit as the base). The flavours were all similar: savoury and rich, with a hint of sweetness from perhaps a honey ham or the bacon. I would definitely order this again.
- Farmer's Breakfast Skillet: from my sister's research, people said that this was also good, so we had to try this as well. The ingredients were quite similar to the Charlie Bowl, but minus the peas and adding mushroom, pepper, and tomato, which are more of your typical breakfast ingredients. The skillet was a smaller portion than the Charlie Bowl, but it was just as rich and filling. The sausages were quite good, and I enjoyed the jam on top of the thick, buttered cranberry sourdough toast that came on the side.
- Cinnamon cream cheese swirl pancake (single): this was also non-negotiable. Wow! This was the first dish to come, so we devoured this (dessert first!). It was really cool how the pancake kind of had the circular layers on the top, like a cinnamon bun. It really did taste like a cinnamon bun in a pancake. Highly recommended. The single is also huge, and so it's definitely shareable between 2-3.
- Red velvet pancake (single): we probably didn't need to order this (I also thought that the pancakes would be like palm-sized, and I was sorely mistaken), but I wanted to try red velvet as well haha. I don't think this was as special as the cinnamon one, because it was just kind of just the red velvet pancake and cream cheese drizzle on top. Could have passed on this one.

Evidently our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and we ordered wayyy too much (probably enough for 3-4 haha), and so we took home plenty of leftovers (half the Charlie Bowl, half the skillet, 3/4 of the red velvet pancake), and even so, I was pretty stuffed for the next 4-5 hours. The food is quite rich and heavy, and the portions are generous. It's also worth mentioning that the service is excellent, despite the bustle of the restaurant. Our server was extremely upbeat and she was constantly coming around to top off and refill our waters - there was rarely a time during the meal that our glasses were empty for an extended period of time. 

Definitely come here on an empty stomach, with some friends to share the food, and early to (hopefully) avoid the lines! 10/10 would come again - a great brunch to start off the day! :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow, I now know why there is a long line up everyday at this place.  We waited about an half hour for a weekday lunch, but it was definitely worth it.  The service was nice and pleasant even at the line up and we had a nice chat with our waiter about the food.  The portion is very generous, almost shocking, because we are not used to that much food served in Vancouver.  But it tastes so good that you'll keep eating until you are more than full!  I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Friends continuously recommended Jam to me and I wish I'd tried sooner. One of the best brunch cafes in Vancouver, everything was spectacular; food, service and coffee. The service was excellent and it was definitely worth the wait! Will return to try other offerings on the menu."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Taking away one star for the horrendous wait time. I understand it usually means the food here is great (which it really is) but I wish they could offer some outdoor heaters :( They open at 8 and I came here at 8.05. Was told there was already a group of people inside eating. Waited until about 9.15 for a group of 5 people and our food didn't come out until about 9.45. I understand we had more people but it was brutally cold and we weren't given waffles like some other customers were given (semi cried through the window from the inside). 

Service here is AMAZING. We were seated and quickly given water. We already knew what we wanted beforehand because of the long ass wait LOL. I got the special Easter Skillet and a cup of London Fog. Tea tasted amazing with frothy milk. Not too much to say. The Easter Skillet was a mix of shaved ham, scalloped potatoes, crispy brussel sprouts and poached eggs. Portion was small but also very filling. We had multiple servers come assist us and all were very helpful. Our server explained which sauces were what and were given a lot of time to eat and chit chat. Never did we feel we were rushed although we tried to be considerate of others. The lollipops at the end were a cute touch. The line up is off putting but the food was tasty. Really like the atmosphere here.

Parking here is from 9AM - 10PM daily (street) or there is also a parkade available across the street. Definitely best to go earlier in the day so you can save on parking."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Had a dirty drunk Chai and the coup for my meal. AMAZING! We sat at the bar and the bar tender, {blonde young lady with cool glasses} she was awesome. Beat breakfast we have had on are vacation from LA. We will be back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best Breakfast I've had in Vancouver so far. My GF and I shared 6 dishes hahah each was amazing. The red velvet pancake stack was huge and took a bit home for later. Also had the oatmeal skillet which I didn't care for, but turns out its amazing! Would go everyday if I could."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great breakfast.  The portions are huge.  Coffee from JJ Bean coffee -  JJ Bean Coffee has a branch right inside Granville Market.
I had the cracking Pork Belly Eggs Benedict - perhaps the best breakfast dish I've ever had.  The Pork Belly had a crispy skin.  Jam gives you a choice on how well you want the eggs poached - I chose medium.  Aside from the Hollandaise sauce, the Eggs Were placed on top of perfectly carmelized onions.  The Eggs Benedict was served with great hash browns- crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside and a small side serving of fruit.
I always plan a breakfast stop at Jam every time I'm in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  I had the Banana Walnut Pancakes and and my wife had and eggs Benedict.  Very clean, quickand great serviceWould have waited longer and will definitely come back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is only my second time having brunch at Jam Cafe and as you've probably gathered from other reviews, the line-ups are sometimes ridiculously long. I thought going for brunch on a weekday would be better but I was very wrong. My friend and I waited in line for an hour before we were seated. We had planned to have brunch at 12pm and lined up at 11:45am but didn't get seated until close to 1pm. Luckily my friend and I had A LOT of catching up to do and time on our hands. If you plan to brunch at Jam, I would recommend going right when they open, as I've heard the wait is maybe 10 or so minutes... or you can always try your luck! 

As ever, though, the food at Jam is unparalleled for brunch. The serving sizes are massive and the size doesn't take away from the taste, it was DELICIOUS. The last time, I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict so this time I went for the pork belly gravy coops. The pork belly was so flavourful, my mouth is watering just thinking about it - it was the melt-in-your-mouth kind of pork belly. The buttermilk biscuit was on the dry side, but the (sausage) gravy on the side and the sunny side up eggs paired so well with it. I would have liked it better if the hashbrown were not packed together because it made it harder to eat with a fork and knife but that's just being nit-picky. I also ordered pineapple juice. Jam Cafe boasts freshly squeezed juices and my friend absolutely loved their orange juice so much, she ordered two glasses. I was not a big fan of the pineapple juice and will likely go for a different one next time. As a side note, their breakfast mimosas are divine.

The prices are great for the food, flavour, portion, and experience at Jam. Our server was lovely and attentive without being overbearing, and that's amazing considering how busy Jam Cafe is. The restaurant has a warm setting, all wood with quirky decorations and it had such a great chill, relaxing atmosphere, making it easy to hear and chat with my friend. Overall, a wonderful experience. 

I'm already planning my next visit."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We tried the chicken and waffles and the charlie bowl. 

Chicken and waffles were pretty amazing. You really can't go wrong with chicken and waffles for a brunch item. Chicken was tender and crispy. The gravy went well with the waffle. I wish there was more gravy; it was just a little on the drier side. 

The charlie bowl was pretty large. I liked it for the consistency of the dish (every bite felt like the first bite). It was plentiful in flavour and in the amount given in the dish. 

I shared both these dishes with my boyfriend. If you want to try more than 1 dish, go with someone because it was pretty filling. Overall it was a good brunch place but I feel like it was rather on the saltier side."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Warning!  Very long lines unless you get there early.  Expect to wait 45 min even on a weekday.

Portions here were huge.  Enough for 2 hungry guys.  I had the large Charlie bowl but the small would have been sufficient.  Hash browns were fresh and topped with cheese, 2 eggs and biscuits mixed with sausage gravy.  The jam was amazing and went well with the toast or hash browns.  My friend had the red velvet pancakes which were about 10 inches in diameter and he could only finish half a stack.  It had good red velvet flavor."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Decent breakfast, large portions. Expect to wait at least an hour to get in. Worth going at least once but it is still only breakfast food."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Don't let the long line outside discourage you. It moves pretty quickly. We came here for brunch at 10:30 on a Wednesday and our wait for 3 people was about 30 mins. That was partly because one person in our group was parking the car and everyone had to be present to be seated so the hostess seated the next group of 3-4 people. I noticed that if you only have 2 people in your group, you get seated fairly quickly though. 

Onto the food. Everyone in our group ordered a meal with fried chicken. I had the gravy coupe, my hubby had the fried chicken sandwich, and my cousin had the chicken and waffles. Everyone loved their meals. I especially loved the gravy and the fried chicken. Soooo good!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There is a rather long wait both to get in and for the food to come, but it's all worth it in the end. The portions are huge and the price is quite reasonable. We ordered a Little Charlie, Brioche French Toast with strawberries and bananas, and the Waffle Board with carmelized apples. All were really good. The sausage gravy in the Charlie hash made the dish. The strawberry/bananas on the french toast added nice moisture and tartness. You could really taste the carmelization with the apples. 

We got there at about 10:45 on a Friday and the line was quite long and we waited about 45 mins for a party of 3. There was still a line when we left and it was almost 1:00."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you are a brunch person this is a MUST try! Get ready to stand in a long line for a table but its all so worth it.

We ordered so much and they were all so good but the Cracker Jack was insane! It is Banana and Nutella sandwiched between two pieces of brioche french toast with whipped cream and fruit. I'm not kidding it was INSANE! We also ordered the Red Velvet pancakes which also was good! Heck everything we ordered was good! 

I will be dreaming of that Cracker Jack for weeks!

Check out my Instagram for pictures @dottie1277"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I agree with the 5-star ratings everyone else has written about this place. Food great. Location great (2 minutes from my airbnb). Wait time....reasonable. If the rest of the menu was as good as my breakfast skillet then I can't wait to come back. That or I'm just very biased towards breakfast, maybe a bit of both."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you enjoy sweet breakfast food then this is absolutely the place for you! We waited about 40 minutes on Sunday for a table, but it was worth it. I have never had such delicious French toast is my life. Their waffles were also just as good!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Coffee is fantastic. Coffee + alcohol even better! Get one of each.  I recommend their iced coffee with baileys - the ""pick me up"".

Every thing looks great and people attack their plates.  I bet you won't finish your plate- the Canadians here are generous with their portions.  Try a breakfast with their fried  chicken!

Beautiful people inside and out.  I love this place. It is worth the wait.  The line is long but when you make it inside there's no rush and it feels so cozy and friendly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The 30+ minute wait was well worth it! Delicious food and fantastic service! I had huevos rancheros with home made jalapeño salsa. And ordered the skillet fried oatmeal to take home. It was also delicious, but more like a dense dessert."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"awwwww I'll have dreams about their Chicken and Waffles.

I've always found it strange that as much as I've wanted to like the combination of Fried Chicken and Waffles (and so many places offer their own version) I've never felt 100% satisfied with this dish. It's like something was always missing. That is until I tried Jam Cafe's - Perfect combination of salted crispy fried chicken, slightly sweet waffle, and an expertly put-together gravy to bring it all together. That's not the Caesar talking either. (side note: the bacon in that Caesar was the second best thing I had for breakfast in Vancouver)

Kiddos ordered pancakes - Red velvet and Cinnamon Swirl I believe. Noone was disappointed. Noone. Let's not speak of the line at the door. What else can you expect with great service and food this good?"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came here with my sister and friend on a Monday morning at around 10:30AM. The lineup at the time was quite long, but after 45ish minutes of waiting we managed to grab a few seats.

We decided to order the smaller sized Charlie bowl and the special that they had on the board called the Truffle Roasted Vegetable & Bacon Hash. This dish specifically was a mixture of truffled cauliflower, mushrooms, asparagus and has topped with two poached eggs and a side of four cream cheese sauce. This dish was incredibly flavorful and I found the portion size to be perfect for someone who was quite hungry.

The small sized Charlie bowl is already quite huge. It is about the size of half a volleyball and the ingredients in this dish make it overall very dense. So while it looks like nothing in the photos.... don't be mistaken! It is very high in carbs and most likely you will not finish half of it in one sitting. But hey, at least it tastes good!

Our service was great and the establishment is very clean. I can see why this place is so popular!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you're in the area, jam cafe is definitely worth trying! & if there's a wait, it's probably worth it to wait (: 

My boyfriend ordered the pork belly eggs benedict & I ordered the little charlie bowl & both were very very very satisfying. Portions are quite generous here & the food is delicious! The little charlie bowl was big enough for me to bring home left overs & eat for breakfast the next day & it was still soOo good. I highly recommend this restaurant & can't wait to come back & try the rest of the items on the menu!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Arrived at 11am on a Monday morning and there was a line about 10 people long. It wasn't a long wait and we were seated at the bar promptly. I got the daily special: a sausage hash skillet and a glass of fizzy lavender lemonade. The lemonade was wonderful! A nice blend of sweetness, lemon, with a hint of lavender. The sausage hash skillet was AMAZING: perfectly poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce, generous portions of sausage, the perfect amount of potatoes. Overall, it made for a delicious and satisfying meal. 
Service was friendly and the interior was cute as well. Try their homemade jalapeño hot sauce! Would recommend to anyone visiting Vancouver, especially during weekdays."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Solid breakfast (or so I am told). Arrived at 1:00, sat down at 2:00, left at 3:00. Great breakfast items for the other members of our party. Having Celiac's, I was left with chicken tacos that held their own but didn't stand out. 

Not the best but cool, small restaurant with a overly touristy vibe.  Wouldn't wait an hour next time we are in Vancouver.  Blue Fox in Victoria was definitely 5 star and worth the wait. 

Very slow service at Jam but we did meet some people in line that made the wait time seem shorter."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really didn't want to go to a place with such a long wait time. I was afraid that it was going to be one of those hyped up places that would only disappoint me. However, I was soooo glad I went. I sat at the bar, so I was able to practically cut the line, and the bartender was extremely nice (so are all the Canadians I've met-- you guys rock!). I had the chicken and waffles, and... {takes a deep breath} it changed my life. Haha, no, seriously. I live in the South of the US. We know our chicken and waffles. But Jam Cafe on Beatty took such a fresh perspective with the pickled veggies and-- it was just perfect. It was so good, I thought about buying a shirt just to remember my experience. I can't wait to visit Vancouver again!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"With the wait and lives up to the hype!  I had their special with the fried chicken and mushroom gravy power the waitress' recommendation and it did not disappoint. Good coffee, delicious flavors, excellent execution. Go here"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best toast and pb&j I ever had! Can't imagine how amazing the actual food would be.  Line starts forming ridiculously early (830am on a Thurs).
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait was at least an hour but the restaurant came out with pieces of hot waffles to stave our hangriness and brought umbrella out when it started drizzling so extra props to service!!!!!  That's some next level customer service and appreciation. 

Food wise - I got ""The Gravy Coop"". Fried chicken with sausage gravy and biscuits with a hashbrown. The biscuit was the best biscuit I've ever had. It was huge, soft and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The fried chicken was also really tasty. I actually think it's reminiscent of the ones at Nightingale. Very juicy. Very flavourful. And it totally made the wait worth it. Hashbrowns were a bit less noteworthy as they were a bit mushy but they were flavoured! 

They also have an extensive list of sides. Among them was the ""Lonely Piggy"". Aside from the super cute name it was a huge corndog with a side of fruit and delicious maple butter sauce. Two major thumbs up. 

Coffee wise - the previous joint in the space, Cafe Medina, has Jam cafe beat. The coffee here is lacklustre. Don't expect unique or delicious coffee. It's just okay. 

Overall the portions are huge and just a casual place to get comfort food. 

Get the fried chicken, waffle and biscuits and you won't regret it!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Worth the wait. For brunch, the line up might look intimidating, but we only waited about a half hour, and it was worth it. We sat at the bar, and the server was delightful. Excellent service. We had coffee and mimosas, a savoury meal each, and shared the cinnamon bun pancake. Divine. I chose the friend chicken and gravy on a biscuit (which apparently theirs known for), and it did not disappoint."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I enjoyed my breakfast here but I think it's overrated. The food isn't that amazing that I'd spend time in a line up outside for. 

We checked it out on a Saturday morning about 30min after opening. Luckily the wait was only around 15min. 

Service was great. We had the Charlie bowl - HUGE bowl. Lots on the top but too many biscuits towards the middle & bottom of the bowl making it dry (even after mixing it up). Also had green eggs & ham (got avocados instead of the ham) - no complaints. Had me at pesto & goat cheese.

Overall a good restaurant but nothing over the top or memorable."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brunch at Jam is awesome, food wise. I always order the Charlie Bowl as it's huge and great to doggy bag for the next day! 

The unfortunate thing about Jam is that it's way too popular. When they first opened you could get a seat in 10 minutes but now it's 30-1:30 minutes for Brunch. No way around this I know, too bad unless you can wait. I'm torn if it's really worth the wait.."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Yadda yadda yadda only good things. Lineups suck but it's a good jam and it's always a hit.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had three stack pancakes. The taste was good. But the volume was too much. If they have a single pancake, I will go there again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fantastic place for a late morning brunch with friends! French toast is amazing.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Line was super long Saturday .. came back Monday morning Food was good, had to wake up early to be first in line"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Interior: Casual
Atmosphere: Friendly, cozy
Food: 4/5
Price: $$
Portions: LOTS 5/5
Service: 5/5
Overall: 5/5

This is probably my new favourite place for breakfast. I went at 9:10 AM and waited about 10-15 minutes before being seated. The staff were super friendly! We ordered a Smoked Salmon Eggs Bene & the Charlie Bowl. The bene was SO good, arguably the best I've had. I recommend adding the avocado! It's an extra charge, but they give you half an avocado, so it's not too bad. The Charlie bowl though... I didn't like it at all. It was very rich and filling, but it very much was just a bunch of breakfast items thrown together-- what koreans might call  (dog food) If you are Korean:    !    ! Anyways, the customer service was amazing, we barely touched the Charlie Bowl and so they graciously took it off the bill for us. Definitely would come here again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing food, totally worth the wait. The veggie breakfast bowl is really good so is the biscuits and eggs. There was a 20 minute wait out the door but it was fast moving. The red velvet pancake was OK (compared to the other food)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had to try this place for brunch during my weekend in Vancouver based on all the great reviews. Fortunately, I came as a party of one, so while I was in the long ass line a server came up to me and said they had a spot open at the bar for one. SCORE. I waited maybe seven minutes.

I have to say that their Jam Mimosa (some peach/ginger concoction with whipped cream) is INSANE. I never have two mimosas before I've eaten but I had no choice. It was sooo good. I cannot recommend this drink enough.

I had the vegetarian benedict and it was delicious! I wish I had known to order something else on the side in lieu of hash browns, although the hash browns were the perfect amount of crispness (I'm just trying to moderate how much crap I eat. Hahahahahaha. It's not working). The eggs were cooked to perfection and I really loved that it came with spinach and mushrooms. And a little side of fruit. Yum! 

The girl next to me actually ordered something that looked amazing and I wish I had ordered whatever that was, but my benedict was delicious and overall my dining experience was great. Love a good brunch spot!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came here on a Friday morning after slobbering over pictures of the pork belly benedict. There was a slight line but nothing I couldn't handle being from San Francisco. It also was about 10 degrees colder in Vancouver so it did test my patience and my jackets. Luckily, since it was just my boyfriend and I, we were seated within 10 minutes. 

The restaurant is on the smaller side and the tables are close to each other but that's perfectly fine with me. I ordered a coffee and the pork belly benedict while my boyfriend ordered their fried chicken with an egg in a biscuit. There's probably a shorter name for this but I'm forgetting at the moment. 

My benedict was topped with a light bbq sauce and hollandaise, and my god, it was incredible. The pork belly was tender and crunchy on the outside. It was like, regular plain old bacon who? The eggs were perfectly runny. It was just a perfect breakfast. My boyfriend's fried chicken dish was so crispy and amazing. This cafe is spot on. 

It is worth the wait but try to arrive as early as you can because I was freezing my butt off in December. But the food more than made up for it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really liked the food here, but simply cannot return as I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for a table one Sunday afternoon. 

While I respect that most popular eateries have a wait period (the lack of reservations in this city is an entirely different issue!), please consider taking people's phone numbers instead of having them stand outside for long periods of time. 

I also understand that I may have been unlucky with my wait time and that it isn't always this long but I genuinely felt I didn't even want to eat after so much of my Sunday was consumed waiting. 

The food and service were very good."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This place gets JAM packed pretty early so expect to come here before it opens or bare to wait in the long line. We got the buttermilk fried chicken with gravy and the waffle board and everything was absolutely amazing!! I think it was one of the best fried chicken and gravy I've ever had! The waffle board is pretty big so I would suggest splitting it with someone. I wish I had a stomach big enough to eat all of it.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"All time favourite breakfast spot. Expect to wait in line, but always worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If there is no lineup in sight, it's either closed already or about to close...

Cozy, hommy, crazily comfortable. 

The red valves pancake is just speechlessly delicious! 
This could be the one and only pancake I wouldn't mind to have every morning.....( if there is no lineup) 
It has the perfect balance of sweetness, moistness, fluffiness and crispness. A must try even if you are not a pancake fan like me. However the portion is huge... so ordering one would be enough. 

Lovely smoked salmon Benedict, hash brown that looks like it's been measured with rulers, and the super filling little Charlie bowl."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Solid 4 Stars. It's good but is it worth waiting 1 hour in the cold? I don't know. We had the Charlie bowl ($16) and the chicken French toast ($17). Charlie Bowl is a mix of everything in breakfast: eggs, hash brown, bacon, bread..etc. Really good but can get pretty heavy. The French toasts were fluffy and I'd eat it again... only if there's less than 15 min wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited in line for 45 minutes and it was certainly worth it!  What an eclectic menu.  We had the chorizo benny and the huevos rancheros.  Excellent wait staff, too!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I have lived in Vancouver for 19 years.  I go for brunch every Saturday.  I am a former chef.

The food here at Jam is very tasty (great hollandaise!), but with the sheer number of great restaurants just in the downtown core alone, there is no way I would tell people that the food or experience is worth the wait.

Great food, but if you have to give up an hour+ of your time, I'm thinking that isn't an equitable trade.

We joined the line at 1:15pm on a Thursday in the biggest downpour ever.  There were 14 people ahead of us and we were seated at 2:00pm.  The normal line up is 4 times that long.

Great food, but don't fall for the line up hype."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Every time we went by this place there was a line. We finally decided to give it a shot. After 45 minute wait we got in and man was it worth the wait. We ordered way more than we should have, but it was worth it. I had the breakfast bowl which was incredible and the lemon raspberry pancakes were good too. My husband had a salad with chicken and that was really good too. One of my favorite places by far in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is amazing!
Three of us visiting Vancouver went to Jam for breakfast.  We had not seen the warnings regarding the long wait times but we got very lucky.  We arrived right at opening (8AM) and were pretty much the last table seated.  By 8:15 there was already a line out front.  But 9:30 the line was nearly to the end of the block!
And the food was amazing!! Great service.  Very good coffee with constant refills.  Large portions.  Tremendous selection.  One of us had a breakfast benny (delicious); another tried the pulled pork pancakes (enormous and fantastic); and another opted for the biscuit with fried chicken and sausage gravy (wonderful w/ perfectly cooked eggs but could have used a touch more gravy)
Really wish we lived in Vancouver because there were many dishes on the menu I'd love to try.  Will definitely visit here again next time I'm in town and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great and unique breakfast spot. Just make sure to get there early!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Had an amazing experience here! The servers are very helpful and fast! Had the smoked salmon eggs benne and it was amazing!!! The line was long but for good reason and it's definitely worth the wait!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cute spot, long wait. Pigs in a blanket was just alright, but I recommend trying other dishes!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The location of Jam Cafe is very convenient, a short walk from the skytrain station. However, I came on a rainy day with my friends and we lined up for about 30 minutes outside before we got seated. If the weather was any nicer, I'm sure it would have been a lot longer! 

We were seated near the entrance, so it was a bit chilly whenever the door opened. However, they provided us with blankets to keep us warm which is very thoughtful!
 
I've heard so many great things about Jam Cafe, particularly their pancakes. Their Red Velvet pancakes have always intrigued me, but I always debated whether it was worth lining up or not. Once I looked through their menu, I had difficulty deciding what I wanted. I ultimately decided on the Red Velvet pancakes and it did not disappoint! The pancakes were huge, and delicious. 

I now see the hype for Jam Cafe, and I wouldn't mind waiting in the rain again for it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We got here around 11:30am and got seated around 12noon.

We ordered the Chicken French toast and the Naan Breakfast Burrito food food and for drinks we ordered London Fog, Blood Orange Mimosa, All Day Rose.

Chicken French Toast was 5/5. Don't really have any complaints. 

Naan Breakfast Burrito was 2/5. Now the overall taste is not bad, but it was too much salad (greens). Nothing like the Breakfast Burritos in California I am used to. I probably won't get this again since all it was was a Naan with some picketed cabbage and 1 slice of avocado. 

Drinks:
London Fog - taste like a mix of tea and milk. I had higher expectations for he taste at first. I would give it a 3.5/5

Blood Orange Mimosa - 5/5. It taste good and the Champagne was not over powering but definitely enough!

All Day Rose - I like this. Never tasted anything like this before. But I am used to drinking Rose water so I'm used to the taste. For those who have never tried rose water, this may be more of an acquired taste but if your not picky, I would say GO FOR IT! I'll give this a 5/5. No complaints on my end."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Three words: worth the wait (in line, which makes five words I guess).

For a table of two on a Saturday at 10:30 am we waited 40 minutes in line ... we stuck it out to say we tried it and I'm happy to say I'll be back! I ordered the chorizo eggs bennie which was delicious, higher quality ingredients than other brunch places. Definitely on par with my other fave brunch at Chambar (the menus are like comparing apples and oranges though so depends on what you're feeling that morning). My friend and I end up gawking at all the other guests dishes around us more than chatting with each other lol Prompt and friendly service with many coffee refills (JJ Bean :))."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The line up moved relatively fast given how many people were waiting. We only waited 30 minutes for a lineup with almost 20 people ahead of us. The eggs benny pork belly was awesome. Pork belly was moist and perfectly cooked. I had the Charlie bowl (full size)...I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting lots of flavours and it was quite bland despite the gravy. Just really average with lots and lots of carbs of hashbrown and biscuit. My
Review is a 3.5 star."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Food was AMAZING. Service was great. Friendly staff.

Friend and I shared the ""little veggie"" bowl. It's not so little!!! And the brioche French toast with banana and Nutella. We had Elmore than enough food. Couldn't even finish...."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Apparently brunch at Jam Cafe is a very big deal. We tried to swing by a few times, and then ultimately made the call to wait 45 min in line. 

They serve JJ Bean coffee (pretty good), and the breakfast/lunch menus were more than enough to give plenty of choice for hungry visitors. We opted for the Charlie Bowl (ham, bacon, hash browns, biscuit, eggs, cheese, etc.) and something else that was also delicious but honestly I blacked out after 2 bites of the Charlie Bowl. When I awoke, my coffee had refilled, my belt buckle undone, I was stuffed, and there was still half of the CB left. One amazing damn brunch, and we didn't even drink!

Stop by here if you're hungry and looking for a wide choice on what to eat.

Major props to the hostess who held a firm line on a group of 8 that only had 3 people show up on time, letting people skip through until the late arrives finally showed."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I wanted to love this place, especially since we waited in line for over an hour, but it just didn't live up to the hype.

Staff is wonderful and the food tastes fresh, but I've had better biscuits, gravy, and fried chicken at two places in Portland, Oregon (Screen Door and The Country Cat).

For reference, I ordered the Gravy Coop with buttermilk fried chicken and sausage gravy. The flavors we're just eh, nothing to write home about. Again, let me reiterate that the service was amazing.

If you can get in with a wait under 20min, totally worth it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is definitely worth the wait! 

Despite this being a small restaurant, I didn't feel rushed at all. Food was delicious and the servers were very kind and attentive. There was never a chance for us to even look for them to ask for anything because they were always around and checking up on us and refilling our waters constantly. Great and VERY clean environment. Good energy. Definitely coming back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,One the best brunch spots in Vancouver. There's always a wait so take that into consideration when making plans. The veggie bowls is my fav as well as their banana nut pancakes. Portions are great as well. They have a house hot sauce that is delish as well.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wait was 1 hr when we showed up at 8am. Food was good and reasonably priced. The salmon egg Benny is 7/10, the chicken and french toast 10/10!!!! Can't be counting calories at this place ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Large portions and friendly staff. I had the Sicilian omelette and it was flavorful, moist. The jam that came with the toast was amazing--couldn't get enough of it. Will definitely return."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We got there around 8:45am and had no wait. Lucky for us because as we finished up and were walking out, the line was LONG! And you gotta stand outside. So if it's a rainy day- I'd recommend getting there early. But totally worth the wait if you do have to wait. I got the skillet feature which had mushrooms, spinach, eggs all atop a crispy hash brown with onion jelly on top and goat cheese. My hubs got the pork belly bene and it was also delic! The house made green sauce on the table was also amazing! Everything being served looked delectable! Highly recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Our first time eating here. It was well recommended by the concierge of the hotel we stayed at and saw the restaurant on TV on the food network channel, so we decided to give it a try even tho there is ALWAYS A LINE to get in. Got a parking spot right in front of the restaurant so hubby and I took turns waiting in line while the kids stayed warm in the car. Ended up waiting about an hour which is not bad after reading reviews online saying that people wait about 3 hours max to eat at this restaurant! Food was amazing and the service was excellent! It was worth the wait! Red velvet pancake was to die for and the Charlie bowl is all your thanksgiving  dinner dreams come true. Coffee was top notch! I recommend this place 100 % We will come back!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I always wanted to try this place due to the reviews I had read. I was warned about the long waiting time but luckily we didn't wait too long when we came around 10:15 AM. There were only about 6 groups of people in front. Nevertheless, the wait was about 40 minutes or so for the three of us. I was actually expecting to wait for longer than an hour. Although it was a small space, I liked how they decorated the interiors. I ordered the fried chicken benedict ($16) and a fizzy lavender lemonade ($3.50).

The lavender lemonade had a strong lavender flavour. I think it is an acquired taste as my friend thought it was like drinking perfume. I thought the drink was refreshing especially with the fizz. The fried chicken benedict looked good when it arrived. The hashbrown looked like it was pre-made in a pan because it was neatly cut. It tasted much better with the house made sauce if you like spicy. The benedict itself was all good except for the fried chicken. I thought it was too dry, almost like chewing on cardboard. I just wished it was more juicy but I did like how they didn't use a lot of batter. The portion was just right as it kept me full for the next 6 hours. One main concern I had was the temperature of the food. It was not as hot as I expected it to be. The hashbrown was cold and the benedict was at room temperature. I understand the kitchen must have been very busy and probably not enough staff to bring food out, but I think the food would have tasted better if it was hotter.

The server was attentive as she came by to refill our water and made sure everything was okay even though it was busy. I think we definitely lucked out on the wait this time. My friend's Charlie bowl looked really good as it came out smoking hot so I will have to give that one a try next time."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Love it!  I discovered Jam Cafe when I was living on the island.  So happy it made it out to Vancouver.

We went on a weekday morning, so the wait wasn't long (I'm surprised there was still a line..a small one haha).  It was yummy brunch food.  One of the best ones in Vancouver, highly recommend!

All items are delicious - I really enjoy their Charlie Bowl.  Its dense but so good.  Definitely a returning customer."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Made the road trip to Jam Cafe from Seattle.  Worth the drive and 50min wait on a Saturday afternoon.  The Brioche French Toast with bananas & strawberries was amazing.  The show stopper was the Eggs Benedict with fried chicken.  It was so good it brought tears to my eyes from being over whelmed by it's flavorful perfection.  Kudos to the chefs, well done! We will be back tomorrow.

Day 2 back again and Jam Cafe didn't disappoint.  This place is consistent in their cooking as they are in their customer service.  Don't forget the garnish.. That plate decoration that you see is as good as it looks!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfast places you will ever eat at, very eclectic, great meals, large portions, cool decor.  You will have to wait to get in but it is worth it, they do breakfast and brunch.  Great value, if your looking for bacon and eggs, not your place.  All dishes well thought out and presentations creative and great, fun watching everyone being seated looking at everyone else's food wit their mouths hanging open.

Waitress said they are looking to come to Seattle, can't wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The cheapest decent food place you will find in all of downtown. 

Diner-style food executed beautifully and delicately. Better than actual diner food but not as pretentious as trendy bougie food. I had the avo tacos and and my friend had the mushroom burger, both delicious to the last bite. Service was also really great- waiter charged my phone while I ate. Will be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Arrived at 8:10am on a sunny warm Wednesday morning, only to be the fourth couple in line for a table. The place opens at 8am!

We were seated fairly quickly around 8:40am. The decor is adorable and has a cute cottage feel to it. All of the servers were nice and knowledgeable about the menu. 

Ended up ordering a little Charlie and fried chicken eggs Benny with a London fog and drip coffee

The little Charlie is not little! It's layers of rosti, biscuit, ham, cheese, sunny side up eggs can fill you up after eating a quarter of the bowl 

Fried chicken eggs Benny also comes with a small side of fruit which helps cut through the heaviness 

The lines are just a given but worth it since food does come out quickly"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Periodic table for breakfast dishes? Now that's science even a history guy like me can understand. You'll have to wait in a bit of a line typically, but it's well worth it. You could get there at 7:42 AM and reduce your wait significantly. It's December, bundle up podnah. You'll need to be prepared to wade through the Canadian version of hipsters, and that's okay too. But it's all worth it! Ft with Sy. Yes, yes, Hb too. No Gr for me. Gotta watch the waistline dontcha know."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fabulous place for brunch but IMP not worth waiting an hour in queue which is usually on weekends.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We were visiting Vancouver and this was our FAVORITE meal that we had. Everything was excellent--from the food to the service. We ordered the Buffalo blue fried chicken eggs benedict , herald street omelette, fruit salad, and house salad. It was delightful! Our waitress was also super nice and attentive. There was a 25 minute wait, but it was so worth it! We ate at the bar. The food wasn't greasy or too salty. We will be back!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wonderful day, a little cloudy and it's not as hot as the last few days, what's better than to wait outside Jam for a table...

We came by this place last summer as well, but we were scared off by the line outside. This year, we decided to give it another try. The wait was around 25mins at 10am, so not too bad. The server was great by coming out every-so-often to inform us of the table situation which is super refreshing as many don't do that. They just make you wait outside. 

The food was fantastic, which is nothing new considering the amount of stars Jam have been getting. The service is warming as well."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Now I can say ""I ate at Jam's and everything they say is true.""  Had the Coops chicken with a side of bacon. Eggs were perfectly cooked.  Requested honey which came in a little pack so I guess that's not as popular here as in other places.  

We arrived 20 min before opening on a  Wednesday and while we got right in, a long line formed and was longer when we left so plan on waiting.  It's totally worth it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious food and impeccable service thanks to the absolutely amazing Noel. She was the best server ever and made our Jam Cafe experience very enjoyable. Their pancakes with maple butter are to die for! And their Jam Cafe iced coffee is the best iced coffee I have ever had. 10/10 would recommend!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yes, it is worth waiting in that huge line. All the eggs bennies we tried were super delicious. The breakfast drinks were on point. What an excellent place, service and atmosphere, and anything you order to eat or to drink is the right choice."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is beautifully plated and delicious. My only complaint about the food is about my maple oven baked oatmeal. It came in a small cast iron skillet with peach compote in the base. I wasn't able to eat it fast enough, and it became soggy.

We arrived at 7:45 am on a Tuesday morning. The line was short, and we were seated right when it opened. 

The main reason that I wanted to write this review is to let all parents of young children know that Jam is not kid friendly. They do not have space for high chairs. I had to hold my active 1 year old on my lap. No matter how tasty a meal, it is not enjoyable for a parent trying to make sure their kid doesn't spill everything or touch anyone with sticky fingers."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great breakfast place, long line ups, but the food portion and service is great!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been trying to get into here forever! 

I woke up super early this morning (a product of going to bed at 9pm) So decided to head to Jam for right when they opened. 

I arrived closer to 8:30 (a 1/2 hour after opening) and there were only two tables left available. I take this as a good sign. 
I mean, what breakfast place is packed full as soon as they open on a Friday morning?

I had a latte to start. It was incredibly creamy and delicious, but my personal preference is to have it a little hotter than it was served. 

For breakfast I had the farmers skillet (13$). Which came with whole wheat toast. The portions are massive here and really dense. So be prepared to take some home with you. 

After my latte I had the fresh orange juice. This was some good quality orange juice I must tell you. Holy
Moly. 

Overall the service was good. I did find it took a while to have our order taken and our food to come. But honestly I am totally fine with that. At least they aren't rushing you out (which I'm pleasantly surprised about considering the line out the door) 

10/10 would recommend. But bring a jacket for while you wait for a table outside."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food and the service was really good. 
The smoked salmon benedict was delicious. I added avocado to it, and it tasted wonderful. The only bad thing was about the wait. We got there at like 8:20am and there was already a line up. But the food and service made it worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"You'll stand in line. The wait for 3 will be about an hour, but you'll do it anyway, rain or shine, because the line won't be any shorter tomorrow and the food is well worth it. 

Pleasant atmosphere, friendly competent staff, and everything we ordered was delicious. The music was a tad louder than I prefer, but that's more of a personal point than a complaint, no one else seemed to be bothered by the volume. 

we ordered:

classic benedict
charlie bowl
standard breakfast
bloody caesar
coffee
mimosa

Everything was cooked perfectly, the multigrain toast was amazing, the bacon is sweet, for sure, and won't be to everyone's liking, but it was quality and I enjoyed it. Hollandaise sauce was wonderful, and the bite I had of the Charlie bowl was double delish.  Coffee was good, the jam was good (of course) and the mixed drink were solid standards."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great food!!!!! 

Long line. 
Parents were super happy with the food they got.
The veggie bowl was huge, enough for two people. Maple butter syrup was so delicious. I coated every inch of the waffle with it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Don't let the exterior fool you! From the outside you could easily walk past this adorable restaurant. Husband said one of the best omelettes he's ever had. The special was a prawn benny. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reason I didn't give it five stars is because I have had similar breakfast dish before that was a bit better. Overall I would definitely recommend and return.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came on a Friday at 1pm and waited about 35 minutes to get seated. I ordered the gravy coops with fried pork belly and my friend ordered the one with fried chicken. The fried chicken was a little dry, but otherwise no complaints. The gravy wasn't too heavy and the biscuit was really good."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The best in Vancouver for brunch! Waited for almost an hour but was really blown away by the food. Big portions so we ended up bringing home some. They still tasted great! Will definitely go back.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I hate hate hate waiting in lines (unless the line is your name and you sit at the bar to wait), but got here about ten in the morning on a weekday (Thursday) and still had to wait in line about a half hour. Anyway, the reviews were good, so I thought it might be worth it and dragged my friend along.

It ended up being okay. We had chicken and waffles and the chorizo bennie. The chicken and waffles were okay, kind of normal fried chicken, a little on the dry side. The bennie was unremarkable. When we left, there was an even longer line outside. Maybe we ordered wrong, but I have no idea why this place is rated so highly on Yelp or why people stand in line for it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was told to try this place out we went and lucked out no waits, had the eggs Benny with bacon so amazing. Service was great but I'm
Not the type of person that likes to sit with people I don't know so it was a little uncomfortable that way but food and service was great"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfast experience's I've had in a while. Not just the food but the staff. 

When we got there, there was a solid 15-minute wait and we got there at 2:30pm (LOL). It was a toss up of the Charlie Bowl or the fried chicken but at the last minute I decided to go with the Charlie bowl and I made the best descion. 

The Charlie bowl was HUUUUUUGGGEEE.. Had all of the thing I love in a bowl, hashbrowns, gravy, biscuits, ham, bacon, cheese and eggs!! The sheer size of the bowl was overwhelming and I would recommend people get the smaller size!!! (I ate the left over bowl for 2 meals after..LOL)

The service was insanely good, the water and coffee never ran out and the place was packed, which was impressive!! 

Hats off to Jam Cafe!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"ZOMG THIS PLACE IS GOOD. Got the 'gravy coops'. Chose fried chicken, comes w a biscuit, 2 eggs, sausage gravy and hash browns. Dam good. Everything was in perfect harmony...fried chicken was moist. Total gut buster of a breakfast, you won't be eating lunch. Great service, there was a steady flow of coffee. I'd for sure be back here. Note: get rdy to cue for a long time.. Local tip: go on a week day and get there early (obvious tip)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is a breakfast joint you don't wanna miss. Pays to be early,cuz the place usually has a line up. Excellent service, great atmosphere, I recommend the Benny's."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great breakfast and brunch spot. Worth the wait. Try their Bloodorange mimosa. If they flew food internationally, id have them send me a full Fried Chicken Benedict plate."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I knew this place had to be good when my boyfriend demanded we come here on our Vancouver trip so he could eat it again. Jam Cafe did not disappoint. there was a slight queue of ~20min max when we went, but the queue definitely got longer when we left. I ended up with the blackstone egg benedict (substituted the tomato for avocado) and it was SO GOOD. The hollandaise sauce was flavorful, the bacon was nice and crispy, and the avocado tasted fresh. Overall, I can see why he wanted to come back and now I want to as well!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm appalled that it took me this long to write a review for Jam Cafe because they are jammin' reggae style, jammin' jammin', and I hope you like Jam too.

I was just wandering Gastown like a meandering tourist with no idea where to eat.  Yelp took me to another restaurant, but I wasn't digging the looks of it. So, intuition took me two stores down and voila!!! Breakfast perfection!

The portions are HUGE (my friend ate it for lunch the next day and she said it was still just as perfect) and in case I didn't mention it enough, it was a perfect breakfast. I was lucky and came when it wasn't crowded because according to the waitress, it gets crowded. I believe her.

This is one of the fastest and easiest reviews I've written because it's just too easy to write about how great it is to jam at Jam Cafe. Yeah, I overdid the jam."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Easily some of the best brunch I've ever had. Get here as a line starts forming well before it opens but if you do get there and there is a line then wait... trust me you won't regret it. The Caesar here is great and so is the Apple cider! All the food was amazing!! Get the cinnamon roll pancakes. They will change your life.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Go early or prepare to wait in line! Great menu with tons of options for meat eater or vegetarians.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious! Always a wait so prepare yourself!! Good parking on the street (paid). Great food. Great service. Had the French toast with blueberry topping. Yummy! Stained my mouth purple though (for those who have to go back to work!)!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I got the fried chicken sandwich and my wife got the pulled pork tacos. The tacos were great with the pickled cabbage, however, the fried chicken sandwich didn't blow me away. It had solid pieces of bacon, but the chicken was a tad dry."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Nice line down the sidewalk at 830Am. Luckily our party of two was seated within 15 minutes. Location is small. Probably holds 40 people at most. We had coffee and ordered naan burrito and veggie bowl. My naan burrito was really interesting. (sorry to any Mexican or Indian folks who think that is culturally appropriated) The goat cheese and red cabbage and House chili sauce made for an excellent flavor and texture with the eggs. Her veggie bowl was savory, hearty and flavorful. The waitress was attentive and friendly. Defiantly a great breakfast. $36 Canadian before tip,"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is delicious, portions are sizable, and service is great. The selection of unique savory and sweet breakfast items is impressive. The other 500+ reviews can tell you that! 

Why 3 stars? The completely inefficient system of standing in a line for a table! You can't put your name down. Your name doesn't get called when your table is ready. (Mainly because there is no host/hostess). You literally stand in line until you are at the door and a table becomes available, sometimes up to 2 hours. Most people do not mind waiting for great food, but it seems like the restaurant makes no effort to improve this by implementing a better system."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My boyfriend and I decided to go out for brunch today as it surprisingly was nice and sunny out. I had heard good things about Jam Cafe so we decided to go. 

When we arrived we found out the wait would be an hour and a half but we decided to stay. With a line so long it must be worth the hype right?! 

I had already gone on Yelp to figure out what seemed popular at Jam Cafe, and so I went with the gravy coop. My boyfriend went with the Big Charlie. My first thought was that there was barely any flavour at all! My gravy coop was basically a sunny side up egg on some plain fried chicken on a biscuit... with a bit of gravy on the side. There wasn't anything special about it. The only good thing about this place is the large portions, but if you don't like the food then that doesn't matter."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really want to try this place. It's right around the corner from my work. But the lineup is so long, I can't bring myself to brave it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely worth the 1 hour wait. I went here in Victoria, and the Vancouver experience is just as good. I would recommended the portebelo mushroom"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Popular breakfast spot, well known to have line-ups running down outside. Luckily we came on a Monday rainy morning and only encountered a small line. The food is extremely delicious and the service was fast despite being crowded. Cozy decor. I enjoyed the ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and my wife the ""Buttermilk Brisket Breakfast"" - awesome choices."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Never been and never will I don't stand in line for for expensive small plates. If you have money and time might be alright just not worth my time. I can cook my own food for the price and time. If you are instagram famous or want to be might be worth your time.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Pro: friendly servers, good food, menu was pretty varied. 

Con: the wait was ridiculous, but a few of us went for a friends' birthday. Also the prices were a bit steep for what we got--brunch food which is comparable to other places that we don't have to wait an hour for. 

I would go back but at a different time!! Be prepared to wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went on the hunt for a good breakfast in Vancouver, after reading the reviews I was set. It must of been my day on arrival I was able to be sat straight about about 930-10. The service was fantastic and the food was exactly what I was looking for. Zero complaints extremely happy!
Thanks jam cafe"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I am 100% a fan of this place. The line up to get in is long at anytime of the day. We went on a Monday at about 10am and still had to wait almost an hr in line. There is street parking right outside but a bit of a wait as well. There was two of us so my partner waited in the car for someone to pull out for a parking spot, while I waited in line didn't take too long. 
Once we finally got in service was pretty quick and quick friendly but nothing special. I guess when the food is that great they dont need anything extra.
Their system is also a bit different here with respects to wait staff, bus person and hostess. 
There are two girls that work the door, take names, seat you , etc.
Then the person that takes your order , brings your drinks and cleans the table. finally there are two other people, may be kitchen staff or owners not sure who bring you your food. anything extra condiments, etc the waiter deals with.
Cant complain their system seems to work and makes sense.
The only complaint is they should just leave a jug of water on your table to prevent you having to ask for refills.
Prices are fair as well, considering the quality and quantity of food your receive.
I got the farmers breakfast skillet, which tasted sooooo good, juicy sausages, good portion of veggies and really I couldn't finish it all. Not to mention all the cheesy goodness on top, thnk u for not skimping on the cheese. yummm cheeese. W a 6$ pancake on the side which tasted like cake sooooo fluffy and sweet, also has a single golden berry on top , which i could hve ordered a whole bowl of those to go.
My partner ordered the chicken and waffles, which came w two fried eggs on top which he wasn't expecting , so the excitement was real. The portion again was huge, crispy waffle on the outside fluffy on the inside. He asked to have the gravy on the side and hold the green onions/peas, which turned out great because I got this amazing maple butter stuff w my pancake and it tasted amazing on his meal. The side of hasbrowns was huge and the perfectly grilled tomato was so juicy 
Decor in Jam Cafe is sort of wood barn like modern, they even had a sign w a list of subway stations from TTC (Toronto Transit Commision) which I thought was odd. 
Negatives: I had a strawberry lemonade(3.50) to drink was amazing, very small and full of ice though :(
Had to ask for the bill more than once for whatever reason, waiter abandon us.
Lastly, our food took extremely long. There were three other groups who came in after us and ordered way after us but got their food before us not sure why.

Id definitely go back but i'm not even from Van so..."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,55 minutes standing on line. We were expecting something great. Not worth. Food was lacking flavor
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wait out the lineup, stay for the bacon. Try their house made ice coffee; it's perfect for summer days. Not the biggest fan of their fried chicken but it's a solid effort for sure. Will eat again...and again....and again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Recommending the Classic Jam Caesar and the Bourbonator Caesar.
In case you're all wondering what those are, its basically a bloody mary just renamed. However their 'spicy house mix' was perfect. Just the right amount of spice, wasn't too overwhelming at all. Made of a very balanced drink. Garnish comes with a bacon :)

Also tried the pick me up, thought it was okay, tasted like a typical iced latte in a sense. Would have probably tried the spiked jam coffee instead next time.

Brioche French Toast with blueberries. Yum. Toast seemed a little dry for how thick the cut was, but never the less was good.

We also ordered the Charlie Bowl, since many yelpers recommended this. Was not disappointed at all. It is forsake a HUGE and HEAVY bowl. Lots of carbs, cheese, filling things. How everything was put together gave the bowl this perfect texture.

If you had to order ONE thing from this place, I would give the Charlie Bowl a try. It's different and worth it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place lives up to its reputation. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent staff. 

We made an effort to wake up extra early on Sunday morning and still had a lineup around the block, but sooooo worth it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best eggs benny I've ever had. Havent had anything like it in all the places I've travelled. Great service.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My family and I got two Charlie bowls, one vegetarian bowl and one chicken waffles. The bowls were HUGE! It was just too heavy for me. It was a mixture of corn bread, gravy, cheesy, ham, bacon and eggs. I would recommend sharing the Charlie bowl. It's too much to eat in one sitting. The corn bread it a MUST!!! It was my favorite. Chicken was a little dry but the gravy was a nice touch. 

There was a line outside but it went by quick. Only waited 25 mins."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is solid western style brunch spot. 

We came here after finding this spot online, not ready for the line outside. We arrived around 11am on a Friday, and had to wait about 1.5hrs for two people. We were willing to wait as it wasn't raining too hard, and it seemed to be one of the better spots in the area.

We ordered something savory and sweet: a brioche french toast and a biscuit plate called the gravy coops. Personally, I am a fan of sweeter brunch plates, and really liked the brioche french toast. The toast was soft and fluffy, topped right with apples, and amazingly sweet. I can see how this could be a bit too sweet for some, but it was great for me. 

The biscuit plate was okay, the biscuit soft but not buttery, and the meats and gravy a bit weak on the meaty flavor. The hash was good though, seasoned right and crispy on the outside, while soft on the inside."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Day 1:
Veggie Benedicte: Awesome. Loved even the hashbrowns. Especially with the hot sauce.
Hot Shot (drink): Did not like it much. No flavor.

Day 2:
French toast with caramelized apples and cinnamon: LOVED IT
Latte lavender: Did not like it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Not worth the lines ups, food is bland  and service was pretty bad not sure what all the hype was about"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is my favourite for brunch! The only thing that stops me from going all the time is the wait.. This place is crazy popular, so be prepared for a line. Even with the (sometimes) 1+ hour wait, it's worth it!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Okay so I was visiting BC for a week from Toronto, and everyday that I was there,  my friend texted me and told me to check out Jam Cafe. I flew in pretty early so I tried to go there the day I arrived around 11 am. There was a line down the street, in the rain! I eventually gave up, walked away. My last day there, I made it my mission to get there on time. Little did I know people lined up over an hour before opening to get a seat. So I ended up getting there just as they were seating the first set of people, and given that I was by myself, I was given the last seat at the bar. Victory!

I was lucky enough to be seated next to some great people, and we became fast friends. I had the chicken and waffles with orange juice. Omg it was delicious!  I still think about that meal. The chicken was the perfect texture, and they have house made sauces that you can try with it which were also very good. Love this place, want to go back to Vancouver and start my trip off here. I was worn down after this huge meal, and was lucky enough to find some ""down time"" walking through the Dr. Sun botanical gardens just down the street."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Awesome place to come, I would recommend to allow for a 45 minute wait but if you come on a weekday around 1-130PM then you might hit a time when you just have to wait a few minutes. 

If you are hoping for a little bite, then it will be hard as they have amazing portions and the food is amazing. The decor is vintage meets hipster. There is a lot of space for the servers to move around so don't worry about people bumping into you. Great looking place.

I loved their london fog so definitely give it a try.

I would highly recommend their little Charlie bowl but it isn't that small. They do have day specials so definitely look to the chalkboard for what it is. I loved their eggs benedict and couldn't choose so we had both the smoked salmon and porc belly- really amazing. The crispiness of the porc belly skin was so yummy and reminiscent of the Chinese way of cooking it. I loved it.

Can't wait to come back. Not the best for groups but if you are 2 then it is easier."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great brunch and options ... good vibe ... unique setting. Great service! I really enjoyed our experience here. Not a place for a big group, more for 2-4 people. It's busy so if you come with a big group you may be waiting a while. The server took their time with my order and triple checked with the kitchen to accommodate everything. No reservations here so you have to wait in line. The only advice I would have is (if allowed), placing portable heaters outside during the cold will help keep the patrons patient. Over all this is on my list of brunch places. They food overall is oversized so you can share or order and eat family style almost"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Our tour bus passed by this place on a sunday morning... anything with a line that long instantly has me intrigued. So, on our last day in Vancouver I went with my brother and S-I-L. We got there at 7:45am (on a Thursday) and were about 10th in line. 
Food was great. Although not sure I would wait more than 30 minutes or so. 
I had the fried chicken on a biscuit with sausage gravy and eggs. Biscuit was just OK--not great. And the hash browns were good, not great. Jalapeno sauce is a must try. I really liked it.
Would definitely like to try this place for lunch with a cocktail."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I returned to this restaurant again this Wednesday. The line was considerably longer this time, and I had to wait  over 30 minutes to get seated. I decided to get the Cracker Jack this time, along with a single Red Velvet Pancake. I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes, although I did find the price for the pancake to be a tad high at $8.5 (the three stack at $14 is a much better deal, but even I, with my massive appetite, probably wouldn't have been able to finish both dishes). Again, the staff members were very friendly and quite efficient, and turned tables very quickly. Overall, I really do like this cafe, although I'm not quite sure whether I'd be willing to stand in line for over 30 minutes for a table again.

Cracker Jack ($15):
4/5
This consisted of two thick slices of brioche french toast sandwiching nutella and banana, and was accompanied by whipped cream and a small fruit salad. It is really hard to go wrong with nutella and banana, and this rendition is just delicious. Previously, I had complained about the french toast in their chicken french toast to be under-toasted; I have to say that the bread in this dish was considerably better, with the edges being quite crispy while the interior is still soft and fluffy. The accompanying fruit was also a nice touch and a good palate cleanser to the sweeter chocolate spread.

Red Velvet Pancake ($8.5):
4/5
This is a fair-sized pancake, although much smaller than the ones from Jethros and The Elbow Room Cafe. Compared to the latter two spots, I have to say that this had them beat easily. The pancake was soft and cakey, and had absolutely no weird smell or aftertaste. I absolutely loved the drizzle of cream cheese that accompanied this pancake. I did find the price to be a bit high for one pancake however; the full stack of 3 at $14 is a much better deal. If only I had a larger stomach..."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Come hungry. Skip a meal before coming. Wear stretchy pants. The portions here are no joke. I love the original location in Victoria so was so excited when I'd heard they opened one at the old Medina spot.

Wait time: 40 mins but it didn't feel long at all as the hostess came out with mugs of coffee and waffle samples for ppl to try as they waited. Great touch and speaks to their excellent service.

Food: like I said everything is XXXL sized, and the food is not for the faint hearted so come with an appetite. We had the Brioche French Toast with bananas and strawberries. Delicous! The French toast was nice and thick, with just enough fruit to accompany each bite. We also ordered the Eggs Benedict with fried chicken and corn salsa. My only complaint here was that the chicken was too dry. Otherwise the rest of the dish was pretty good. The corn salsa is a nice touch and love how their hash browns are not too oily. They have a bottle of green sauce on the table that tasted like salsa verde, but it wasn't very spicy and was delicious with the hash browns. Regular coffee is bottomless. Their London Fog was good and from JJ Bean.

Will return next time to try their red velvet pancakes. This place beats Medina Cafe BY FAR in terms of food and service."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waiting a hour for breakfast! First time and will be the last time! I have pretty high expectation for the taste. I admitted the presentation is vey Instagram worthy! Interior design is pretty cozy! But the taste was okay! The portion is big, however bigger portion means more money. We walk away with big disappointment on the food, service was 5 star"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fried Chicken French Toast and vanilla latte coffee are too sweet for me.  My mom ordered a regular size charlie bowl. It's too big for one adult. 

The taste is ok, but not worth the long wait time."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had this place bookmarked for quite some time and so I was very excited to try this out. Brunch spots, downtown Vancouver, and cozy cafe feelz are all things that I look for in a great restaurant. That being said, I was rather disappointed by this place.

Firstly, after calling in and asking about the wait, we were told that the line would die down to about 10-15 minutes at 2pm. We arrived a few minutes before 2pm but ended up waiting for 45 minutes. Luckily, there was a PokeStop nearby so bae lured it and we killed some of our wait time.

Once we were finally seated, we ordered. I got the chicken and waffles. Admittedly, I have never had chicken and waffles before so I was both anxious and excited to try this new combination of food. When it arrived, the first thing that I noticed was that it was lukewarm. Upon first bites, it was tasty. The sausage gravy had just enough saltiness to it and it combined well with the sweeter-than-normal waffles. However, the chicken was dry though I will admit to disliking chicken breast in general. I also wished that the waffles were crunchier and fluffier. They were too soft for my liking.

Overall, the food was good enough but certainly not worth a 45-minute wait. I'd much rather go somewhere like the Red Wagon or Yolks for breakfast or brunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"1 hour to get a table, $4 For half an avocado, Mediocre food...... DEFINITELY NOT MY JAM
People just go to a place cuz there's a line-up assuming the food is great. Which in some cases is, but surely not in case of Jam. We tried the gravy coop, Huevos rancheros, The breakfast skillet, Chicken French toast and the three pigs. None of the dishes were great by any means. Especially considering you standing in line for an hour.


Food : Ok
Service : Friendly
Ambiance : Hipstery / Casual
Worth the price (And wait) : Nada"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"After two failed attempts of walking from my work in Yaletown to Jam Cafe in Gastown to enjoy brunch at Jam Cafe, I finally got around to eating here. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about after hearing ""approx. 50 minute wait"" every time I tried to get in. ""It's just eggs"" I thought - what's the big deal?

The third time around, my friend and I decided to suck it up and actually wait in the cold for 50 minutes before getting seated. While we were waiting in line, a waitress brought out waffles for us to try (10/10 convinced us to stay in line). Since we had all that time to wait, we decided on what to order as soon as we got seated: Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($14), The Gravy Coupe ($15), and a single slice of red velvet pancake ($6).

We started with the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was incredibly flavourful, and definitely the lightest one out of the 3 dishes we ordered. It was paired with a few pieces of fruit and hash browns. And my goodness - those hash browns. So nice and crisp. I could've ate just a bowl full of hash browns. The portion is large enough to make you full, but keeps you wanting more. At $14, the portion size and quality makes this the salmon benny with the most bang for your buck in Vancouver.

Next up we had The Grave Coupe. This was my favourite out of the three dishes. It is definitely a heavy meal. I mean, it includes a large biscuit, fried chicken, 2 eggs, hash browns, AND sausage gravy. Carbs on carbs on carbs! I would've never thought that eggs and chicken would have made such a nice pairing. It's extremely delicious, and although I felt like I was going to explode by the end of it, I didn't want it to end.

The red velvet pancake is not your average pancake - it's huge. It was super fluffy, and tasted exactly like a rich red velvet cake would. The cream cheese icing was a great addition, making maple syrup unnecessary.

As annoyed I am that they don't take reservations and I'll have to wait a lifetime to get a seat next time... I'll totally come again to try their other dishes. The homey vibe, delicious food, large portions, and good prices makes Jam Cafe a huge contender to being one of the best brunch spots in Vancouver. A must try!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Had the eggs benny fries chicken and the charlie bowl.  Both were okay and the portions were pretty decent.  I went on rainy Wednesday at around 10:30am so the line up was only about a half hour.  I would say that you the food is good for the price but not worth the line up.  I've had better brunch elsewhere, same price range."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Surprisingly, there was no wait to eat at Jam on a friday morning though the place was pretty packed when we arrived around 9am.  The menu had plenty to choose from - from sweet, savory and 'healthy.'   I opted to get a smoked salmon eggs benedict since that came highly recommended .. It was one of the best benedicts I've had.  The english muffin was perfectly toasted, while still being soft enough to chew and enjoy.  The salmon was great, the hollandaise sauce was rich, but not too heavy, and you could opt for a soft, medium or hard boiled egg to suit your fancy.  So good.  My friend got the fried chicken french toast, which she really enjoyed as well.  The pickled cabbage was a good savory addition to the sweet and salty, and the dish was of a huge portion as a whole.  
       The whole time we were there, everyone was oohing and ahhing at the presentation of different dishes that were served to and around us at other tables.  It was one of those few times that the presentation noticably contributed to the excitement of eating / dining experience as a whole.  Mine did look pretty uninteresting in comparison to everything else, but the flavors more than made up for it.  
    The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the hash browns, but that was more filler anyways... and the fact that the tables are sooo scrunched closely together - to the point where you can bascially have a waiter's backsides almost sitting in your dish at times.   Anyways, if you're lucky, free parking can be found on the street right outside of Jam as well (that is, until they install parking meters ;) )."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Uhm...hour and 45 minute wait, with no rain, but 45 degree temperature and it was WORTH THE WAIT! The fried chicken french toast, with that sweet tomato salsa stuff was unREAL! So good! 

Pan fried oatmeal with lemon curd and blueberry....kind of like a little pan of heaven! 

Friendly wait staff! Small tables. Eclectic music, cool design. Definitely our best breakfast while visiting Canada."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Looking forward to an amazing meal ! Always a wait but for sure with it ! Beautiful decor and incredible menu !
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Let me start by saying I tried out Jam one early Saturday morning before I was heading out for the day and skipped the line entirely.

The decor is very similar to Cafe Medina the previous occupier of this joint and by adding more antique and cute items they have managed to give this place a more wholesome feel.

Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by the host and then shown to my lovely table by the window. I was seated in a nice location even though I was dining solo! In a town filled with snobby servers and bad attitudes, Jam's got the right staff to stand out.

I started off with a Mint tea and a half order of Chorizo Benny with a side of hash browns. The tea was nothing special but the highlight of the meal was the perfectly made hash browns. 

Overall I wasn't very adventurous that day so will definitely come back to try more items off the menu."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food was good with lots of flavors, but a bit rich for me. We had the smoked salmon benedict and chicken french toast. Both dishes were pretty good. 
The Jam Royale coffee with Patron and Godiva chocolate liquor was fantastic. Service was nice and helpful. The restaurant was busy with long lines during prime time."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"good service
unique food/ taste was ok , not a big fan of the too sweet or too sour dishes / I wouldn't line up again for this place 
over priced but the portions were huge/ can be shared
family friendly but the place is a little small 
would I go back? No"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food here is delicious but honestly I wouldn't line up for it again.  I love brunch and thought I had to give it a try.  My husband got the chicken with waffles and I got the Charlie bowl.  It was both delicious but it was actually a bit too rich and just not worth the 45 min wait.  The price was also not great value, especially considering the extra wait.  There are so many amazing brunch places around Gastown and Main St.  I feel like some people like to line up to feel like they're working for it somehow and getting something special?  Not worth the hype.  Back when this location was Cafe Medina we could put our names down and go for a walk.  Now you have to physically stand in line and it drives me crazy.  I can't understand why people do it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came here on a Sunday at 11:30am, and the line was really long. It already went down the street for quite a bit! The wait was quite long, which reminded me of Medina Cafe. The wait here was an hour and 10 minutes. Also, there was a bad smell of pee or something gross during the wait the whole time. Which obviously isn't the restaurants fault, but it does affect it. During the wait, a waitress also came out and gave samples of their waffles. 

Upon entering I noticed how they had such cute, hipster and antique displays in the walls. It made the place look very interesting. 

What I ordered: chicken & waffles ($16) and a blood orange mimosa ($7). The chicken & waffles was delicious, it had the perfect amount of saltiness to it, and the chicken was very nicely cooked! The mimosa on the other hand, I didn't quite enjoy. First when it got to the table I noticed that it was rather small. And when I tasted it, it wasn't that good as well. Maybe because I wasn't a fan of the taste, or maybe it was actually just bad. 

All in all, the food looked very nice and taking photos of it is quite easy. 

Would I come back? Maybe. I'm not sure if I want to wait in line again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Worth the wait. If you want a taste of local food with a twist, this is the spot. Everything on the menu is amazing and fairly affordable for the area. Great coffee and cocktails."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm usually not much of a breakfast foods person but this place I would definitely make an exception for! They've got some staples and then some mouth watering temptations on their menu that is worth having breakfast for ;P  That being said, I'm still not sure I'd wait the long line up to get in...but that's just me...when I want food, I want it in my belly in less than an hour's time wait.  So I wouldn't ""swing by"" here but if you are prepared to have an ordeal waiting for breakfast, I would definitely recommend this place!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Having previously lived in Victoria I was quite excited to hear Jam would be making its way to Vancouver.

I'd waited outside several times at the original location and was obsessed with each visit. The food was always phenomenal.

I can honestly say the same for the Beatty location.
I recently went for a friends birthday and the food was amazing. We all shared so that we could try more dishes.
yes, the lineup is always a little ridiculous but the wait is well worth it.

If you have two hours to spare (one in line and one inside) then I definitely would suggest giving it a try!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious!

We arrived 10 minutes before the door opened for the morning, and there was already a line. That's a good sign for me! The staff was welcoming and friendly to start the morning--seating us for the breakfast experience. 

My husband and I usually split a meal, and we were tempted to stray from that plan because we could hardly decide. But in the end, we agreed to share the full size vegetable hash. 

We were shocked when it arrived to the table. The bowl was so big--full of eggs, hash browns, biscuits, veggies... it was everything I could have hoped for. The eggs were a bit runny on top, which is great for me. The mushroom gravy was great--gotta learn to make that! We shared the bowl and still had leftovers to eat for lunch. 

I also had a classic Caesar/Bloody Mary AND coffee. 

The environment and the wait staff were lovely as well. I'd highly encourage anyone in Vancouver to check this place out. If I were local, it would be a regular spot for us!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Their breakfast is freaking amazing. It is one of the best places in town for breakfast/ brunch.

The only down side is the line ups to get in. You have to wait for too long to get a table. They definitely need another location or a bigger one."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I always see a line-up, so my boyfriend and I decided to go for brunch on a Saturday.  The wait was about 30 minutes for the two of us (it's definitely much longer if you have more than two people).  One of the servers brought waffles and syrup for everyone in line, which was really nice and definitely appreciated!

First impression was that they have an amazing menu!  Most brunch places, you can generally pick out a few fan-favourites, but everything on their menu actually sounded amazing!  My boyfriend went for the skillet and I chose the fried chicken brioche french toast.  Both were sooooo good and portions were huge!  I would recommend both.  We also had drip coffees, which are from JJ Bean -- Love to see them supporting local coffee!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here twice while visiting Vancouver. Def. worth the wait (first time got there at 8:05 am and was seated a hour later. second time got there at 7:50 am and was seated when it opened). Both times I got the Maple Pan Fried Oatmeal which was just delicious- if you're an oatmeal fan then you will enjoy this. First time my husband got the smoked salmon benedict which he was a fan of and the second time he got the huevos rancheros which he didn't enjoy as much. Overall, great experience, kid friendly, and would go again"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My husband took me to Vancouver for my bday weekend and of course very important on the trip was where to go for breakfast. We looked through many yelp reviews and being that pancakes are a definite must in our lives, we discovered Jam Cafe. They have red velvet pancakes on their menu, and let me tell you, these pancakes melt in your mouth and go straight to your stomach, especially with a heap of their cream cheese sauce. Their coffee is VERY GOOD and was the perfect complement to the red velvet pancake. 

I had The Gravy Coop, which was a fried chicken patty in between two giant biscuits, with a side of sausage gravy (yum), a nice helping of hash browns, and two perfectly sunny side up eggs on top of the chicken and biscuits. I was thoroughly satisfied. 

My husband had the Herald omelette with cheddar cheese, green onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms added; it came with hash browns, toast (sourdough is always our choice), and chicken apple sausage on special request since he is pork averse. My hubby practically licked his plate clean. His toast came with a special strawberry jam that was so fresh, sweet, and tasty that we asked them if we could take some home--they kindly obliged and gave us two helpings of it to take home. They also have a fresh, homemade jalapeno sauce that really brought out a lot of flavor in the entire omelette. So yummy! To our surprise, we found out that they sell this sauce and we quickly said 'yes, please!'  when our server asked if we wanted to buy some.  

We came late (around 2:10), so we thankfully missed most of the rush that many people talk about in the yelp reviews and we only waited about 15-20 mins before getting seated. We loved the rustic atmosphere and decor. The only downside is that they accidentally forgot to put our order in initially and we waited close to half an hour before they realized the mistake. We waited another 20 mins before the food came out. It was a long wait but worth it in the end bc the food was so good. They comped us our pancakes and coffee, which helped make up for the time lost as well. 

Overall, this place was great and we would certainly come again. I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 bc of the wait mishap but otherwise it was top notch!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best breakfast place ever.  I wish I could take this restaurant back with me to Hawaii...   Everything we tried there was amazing but their bacon is to die for.  There is always a line there but it moves pretty fast for a small place.  I could eat here every morning if I could.  Definitely will be back here for my next trip to Canada!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great food, great portions, great variety. 
Be prepared to wait in line for a while, they don't take reservations and you can't have your name on the list, you must wait in line even if it's poring rain."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here for breakfast on a weekday, arriving around 8:05 a.m. (it opens at 8:00 a.m.), and the place was almost already at full capacity!

*Note: Come prepared to feast at Jam Café, as their portion sizes are massive! 

MAIN DISH: Green Eggs and Ham 

I wanted to explore what Dr. Seuss meant when he said ""green eggs and ham"", so that is precisely what I ordered. The pesto and spinach in the scrambled eggs made the eggs themselves very moist, which wasn't too pleasant - but the taste was there. The hash browns were my favourite part of the dish, as they were crispy (yet not oily). The jam and buttermilk biscuit were also very delicious, especially the jam, which is made in-house. On the other hand, the ham was quite dry, so I found myself dipping it into the jam to somehow give it some moisture. 

While the service was lovely, I was somewhat let down by the food, given the reviews I read and the long line-ups I had seen to get into Jam Cafe."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Another breakfast place, where Cafe Media used to be...

Normally, I don't wait when I see more than 4 ppl but I'm going to make an exception.  That's how great this place is.

First off, it's more than just a cafe; servers real breakfast food, and not a coffee joint.  Quite the nice decor, a bit heritage mixed.

The Little Charlie: this could feed 2 easily, just their version of a hash, with amazing sausage gravy, buttermilk biscuit with great texture, and plenty of ham.  Highly recommended.

The pork belly eggs benny also a winner, though the hash browns were just alright, a bit too much of a cake and not fluffy to what I like.  Nice presentation with the fruits.

They sure do pack the seats quite close together, yet it's noisy enough not to really hear what your neighbours are saying.  It's a place to be seen.

real good service, if you get Emma.

yay, they even offer milkshakes, had I known, wouldn't order my green tea.

Should've bumped them to a 5 star, as they accept AMEX.

Hats off for them to open a new resto in new territory, as they have one in Victoria."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm visiting from Los Angeles and I stopped here after a morning 5 mile run around the city to work up an appetite. I arrived a little before 9 and there was a line! I got in line and searched around for an alternative breakfasts place because I was hungry and impatient. Nothing else nearby looked good after a few minutes of searching... I glanced up and I was near the front of the line! Score!!

Since I was dining by myself, I was seated quickly at the bar. I was given a menu, given a glass of water and offered coffee immediately (which I eagerly accepted)!  The drip coffee includes free refills and the beans are from JJ Bean- super tasty and well-brewed. 

The menu was quite extensive and breakfast is served all day. They had hashes, eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, biscuits, yogurt and oatmeal- anything you can wish for. 

I ordered the Little Veggie Bowl, which was a hash with hashbrowns, a crumbled biscuit (the star of the bowl), mushroom gravy and a ton of vegetables and cheese topped with two eggs that I got soft poached. Ermahgerd- it was amazing! The biscuit is fluffy, dense and nicely flavored. The gravy is salty and complements the hashbrowns and biscuit perfectly. There is a generous portion of cheese. One of my eggs were hard poached and the other was soft poached but they both tasted good and it didn't bother me too much. 

The bowl is massive for a ""little"" bowl. I couldn't even eat half of it by myself after a long morning run! I packed it to go to eat in a few hours while I sightsee. I left around 10 AM and there is still a line of about 20 people outside. I know they won't seat you if your entire party is not there, so I suggest coming to an agreement with your friends that whoever arrives late is left behind!

Service is fantastic and everyone is so friendly even though they are busy! They give you a dum dum lollipop with your check.

I highly recommend coming here. At the very least, get the biscuit, but I implore you to try the veggie bowl."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"be prepared to wait! we came at 10am and waited for a good 45 mins.. we had no where else to be anyway so i guess that was fine~

we ordered chorizo egg benni and the gravy coop.  the chorizo didn't resemble chorizo really but it was still good~ my favorite tho.. was definitely the gravy coop! the gravy was to die for! so rich and scrumptious! portions are huge btw so def come hungry!

as much as i enjoyed my brunch here, i thought the place was a little overrated.. i probably wouldn't travel too far for this place~"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great food but the line up is insane. I only go like once every 6 months because of this. (No names just have to stay in the line to save your place for an hour or two). They should open up a couple more locations!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So the only bad thing about this place is the wait. We were in town meeting with some friends and came here for Sunday brunch. The line was a bit long and didn't anticipate the two hour wait. If the weather is good and you don't mind hanging out, your patience will be rewarded. We each had a different brunch order, I chose the Gravy Coips, fried chicken on a buttermilk biscuit with gravy topped with an over hard egg. Wow. My wife had the Salmon scramble and our friends had the brioche French toast and a vegetarian bowl. Everyone raves about their meal. We also split the pan fried oatmeal with fruit and topped with lemon curd -- which was out of this world. They have a great brunch cocktail menu and our server was a delight. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vanxouver, it was one of the best and most memorable breakfast spots that I can remember."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We waited in line outside for about 45 minutes for breakfast on a Friday morning but they came around taking coffee orders in line which really helped. The menu is full of a bunch of options. I liked my skillet but my bacon wasn't very well done and a bit too thick for my taste. So I'll try something else next time but lots of options and great cozy atmosphere
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Not bad, but not worth the lineup (30 minutes at 11:45am on a Wednesday).

I had the Farmer's Breakfast Skillet, and a famous Red Velvet Pancake on the side. The skillet was very generous with the cheese (yay), but in a manner such that it globbed all the flavors together (not yay) - each bite tasted almost the same. Not a bad taste, but still, the execution could have been better. The pancake was more disappointing: once it cooled a bit, it somehow developed an almost pasty, chewy consistency. Very laborious to eat for that reason, and I didn't finish it. Never encountered that with a pancake before. 

The space is very pleasing, and the service was good. Sadly the food quality just didn't live up to the hype."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We are in Vancouver for a couple of days and wanted breakfast. There was a line down the block and an hour wait. We have things to do and a day to kick off and I don't like to wait. My wife had a brilliant idea. Order to go and sit in the park for a picnic. 
I had the green eggs and ham, my wife had a half classic bennies, and my son had he chicken and waffle. 
We were blown away! 
1) very courteous service from call to pick up. 
2) sauces packaged separately to not make food mushy. 
3) sauces all homemade and very fresh. I can taste the quality. 
4) all the food was on point! Delicious from start to finish. 
5) nice morning to dine in the Stantec park across from train station. Worth it to wait if you have time or get to Togo, this is excellent because service they know!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Another visit, another excellent breakfast.

Fried Chicken Benedict was perfect. Moist chicken inside, crispy  outside.  The eggs were totally perfect, nice an runny yolks. Good VFM.

The wait on a Sunday (from 11am) was over 1 hour for a table of 5. 

Come on a weekday if you can. No lineups."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We have only been visiting from Chicago for four days and we have already been here twice. We thought that there would be less of a line on a weekday, but people were still lined up waiting to get in on a Monday, and believe me it's worth the wait.  I heard that people even wait outside in the winter! The inside was small, but cozy with very interesting decor. My daughter especially loved the periodic table of food! I thought nothing could beat the Harrison Salmon Scramble, which is what I had the first time, but then I had the Veggie Bowl and it was outstanding.  I have a hearty appetite and I could barely make a dent in it. The waiter told us that it used to come in two sizes and I was eating the small bowl!  My daughter had the eggs Benedict and said it was spectacular.  If you are visiting Vancouver, this place is a must. They serve breakfast all day and close at 3.  People were still lined up outside when we left at 1:30.  The wait staff was very fast and courteous.  We spoke to who I believe was the owner who was also incredibly nice and hard at work in helping out."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Just go - it's brunch heaven.  I'm not one to wait in line for a restaurant, but I did. So glad I did."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ah, this was my last meal in British Columbia. My friends and I arrived at about 9:30 AM to maybe twenty people in a single file line on the sidewalk. We weren't perturbed in the least. We ended up waiting around 15-20 minutes before being seated.

The restaurant is cute and cozy. The food was decadent, very hearty portions. I ended up getting some sort of bowl composed of biscuits and gravy. I believe it to have been called The Little Charlie. 
It came out from the kitchen piping hot. You can tell they put meticulous care into each dish they produce."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I've walked by Jam every day for the past 2 months while working in Vancouver and there is always a line up.  One early morning before a road trip I was able to get in before the line up was too long. WOW!  I get it now!  Friendly service!  Great quality!  And wonderful options.  I have been back 3 times in the last month.  HINT:  Go early.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing! Loved the food and service. We went on a very cold Thursday morning at 08.20 and the place was stuffed! Luckily we managed to get a table but others had to wait outside. 
I was very annoyed by the additude of the table next to ours. When we arrived there were 2 guys already sitting at the table (one for 4 persons) and they told the waitress that their friends would join them. Well they did but 45 minutes later! The 2 guys who held the table had already ate their breakfast. Their friends (3 of them) just skipped the line of people who were waiting in the cold and ordered. Also, there were now 5 people at this table that was actually a table for 4 persons. When we left, the 3 friends just received their food while the other 2 just sat their and talked (bc they were already done eating 30 minutes ago). The waitress pointed out to them that they skipped the line but did nothing to stop this."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic food, great vibe, really nice employees. This all adds up to an A+ experience. We're only in Vancouver for a couple of days...wish it were longer so that we could come back and try several other items on the menu. I ordered the Chicken French Toast and  and it was both savory and sweet. My husband had the green eggs and ham and didn't stop raving about all morning. Call for reservations! But if you don't...it's worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait is worth it.

I'll make this review short and sweet.
Food: Delicious. Everything we ordered was soooo good. 
Service: Amazing. Even though it's packed, our waitress would make conversation with us. 

I want to go back~~"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We're visiting from Seattle for long holidays. Quite long wait even on a Monday morning! Staffs were really nice and friendly. We ordered chicken waffle, the little veggie bowl, the old town, and the three pigs. My aunt liked the 3 pigs a lot. Veggie bowl was just full of hash brown really, meh. The old town was pretty good. Chicken waffle was a disappointment. 2 stars for this chicken waffle. Waffle is so dense and chewy. It doesn't even absorb the syrup! Gravy was thin and pukey with big chunks of pork. Ick! The only thing good on this place is the egg. Quite disappointed overall."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Ridiculous breakfast spot! Must try when in Vancouver. Pancakes were delicious. Get there early because it's a small restaurant and lines start out the door. We waited 45 minutes on a Sunday and got there around 9.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!! Ok... maybe 20 minutes, but 1 hour+, nope.  

The food is good.  I had the chicken and waffle.  It is a tasty plate of an entire week's worth of calories and fat.  I will say the waffle and chicken were a bit bland.

My wife got a Bennie and enjoyed it.  She like that you could do a half order.  

We also got the bruleed grapefruit.  This was good, but the slice job was amateur hour.  They cut into the pith and didn't segment it.  I would rather them not touch it and let me do the cutting.  

The drip coffee was really good.

Our server was great.  She was very friendly and attentive.

This is not earth shattering breakfast food."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is one of my favourite places to go for brunch! It always has a line up so either come bright and early on a weekday or have the preconceived notion that you will be waiting in line. But I will say that the wait is definitely worth it. 

Their portion sizes are great, with some being huge! I have almost all of the time taken leftovers home! One of the things that I really like about this place is that no matter how busy they are, inside or outside, they never make you feel like you need to leave because they need to serve the next table. The staff is friendly and they really let you take your time. Food and drinks definitely come out in a timely manner but I know I have had the opportunity to sit and chat with friends without feeling bad about it. Definitely a place I will keep coming back to!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place had the most amazing cinnamon cream cheese pancakes I have ever tasted!!  

There is always line up out the door but totally worth the wait. One thing I really like is that they won't seat you unless your entire party is present.  This is a small restaurant so this ensures that tables aren't being taken up by people who are waiting for the rest of their party to arrive.  

The service is always great and fast!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow, Jam was definitely worth the wait. A lot of reviews have stated, ""there will be likely a 30 minute plus wait,""  which I can confirm is true. The huevos rancheros was the best I have ever had! Service was inviting and the ambiance was perfect for the style of dining we experienced. I cannot wait to get back here."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Having heard so much good things about this place, finally came around to visit. I was reluctant to venture to this place because of hearing about the waiting period, and its not exactly in my neighbourhood.

Anyways, ended up waiting for about 1:20hour, but the staff from the resturant actually came out midway to offer us free samples of their waffles ( which was quite good) and thoughtful.

When I finally got seated, all the staff was really nice and my husband and I ordered the ""charlie bowl"" and ""chicken with English muffins benedict"" 

The chicken on was good, but no surpise there. 
The Charliebowl was too big for me, you can probably share it with a friend next time and order another sweet item. And it was in my opinion way too salty.. i only ate 1/4 and could not finish it. But the portion was really big, worth the cost.

I still give Jam 4 stars despite the long wait and too much salt, because of the exceptional customer service, but it would probably be a looong while before I come back again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"As a local, I tend to avoid places overrun by tourists. However, after a convincing promotional video by Dailyhive, I decided to finally bite the bullet and stand in line for the Jam Cafe. I ordered a Charlie Bowl and the Nutella Banana French Toast. Both were large and very filling. The Nutella Toast was out of this world- insane! Although it was sweet, the whipped cream was not overly sweetened and balanced it out. After reading raves of the Charlie bowl, I have to admit I was slightly let down. A mushy bowl of mixed up biscuits and gravy with some extra bits of meat, it was too carby for my taste. Although I undoubtably love carbs, I would suggest having some sort of fresh veg or vinaigrette or something on it to lighten it up. Coffee was abundant and excellent (JJ Bean). 

Although I would probably visit for the food again, the customer service is the real winner. Our server was funny and attentive, and it was super amazing to see the owner taking orders and bussing dishes- he obviously really cares about his restaurant."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This was not a place to go to if you are in a hurry, but if you have time to wait in line you will enjoy the food. It was interesting and seemed like a young crowd.  Lots of students were there at 10am on a Tuesday."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Arrive early. You will likely have to wait in line for awhile but trust me when I say it's so worth it. Once you go inside, you'll see everyone with such amazing food and having a great time. Portions are large, well priced, and are proud residence's of flavourtown.

Highly recommended!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yum! Waited 2 hours but this place is definitely one of the best brunch places I've been to. I had the Charlie Bowl and it's massive. Great value for the quality of food. Has my vote! Would love it even more if they took reservations though, instead of making customers wait in the cold for 2 hours."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There will ALWAYS be a wait, especially on weekends but I assure you it 100% worth the wait! I've had both brunch and lunch here several times. The pulled pork pancakes bring sweet and savoury to a whole new level. Eggs Benedict come with fried chicken, bacon, or even salmon! Lots of options and everything always tastes great! Even though you might wait, once seated the service is quick."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious pancake with kind workers! I wanna try other menu too :) I really like this place. I recommend share one with two! Too much for me and ma friend.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious!!! We waited for quite a while to get in for a Sunday brunch, however it's so worth it!

I had the huervos rancheros and they were so tasty! I had been to the location in Victoria a few times before, so I knew it would be good. I will definitely be back when I have the time to wait in line!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great place to have your morning meal in VVR... any wait time makes your meal taste better!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Really enjoyed my experience at The Jam Café! Everything from the food to the service and vibes, it beat my expectations. Here's a break down:

FOOD:
I got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and avocado. Man, it was pretty freaking delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly so that they would ooze out beautifully and the hollandaise sauce was smooth and creamy. The dish is served with hashbrowns, nothing out-of-this-world, and some fruit on the side. The salmon itself was smoky and rich and the English muffin was toasted to perfection. All together, it made for a great brunch meal! The avocado was also a nice addition.

Most of the friends I came with got the Charlie bowl. I'm sure you can tell from the other reviews that this is no small dish, regardless of the half size. I tried it and I wasn't too impressed. Sure, it tastes great but, at the portion size, it's easy to get tired of the taste after like 10 bites and many of my friends got bored with the meal.

SERVICE:
Expect a long wait. We were a pretty large group so it took about an hour before we were seated. Service was good overall and our waitress was friendly.

PRICE:
To be honest, I paid $18 just for my eggs benedict which is pretty much at the edge of what I would pay for for such a dish. $4 of my new came from the avocado alone, which was certainly good, but probably not worth it at that price. A lot of their menu items are pricy, but I think it's worth the dent on your wallet overall.

Would definitely return! Great food, vibes, and service (albeit pricy + a long wait)!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited in line for over an hour, but it was so worth it! Though on the pricy side ($55 for three people), the portions were huge. We ordered a little CHARLIE BOWL, which was packed with flavor, a FRIED CHICKEN EGGS BENEDICT which was delicious although the English muffin was a bit hard, and a HUEVOS RANCHEROS. Everything was delicious and enjoyable. Would highly recommend as long as you're willing to wait! You will be rewarded for your patience :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I mean, it's good. I'm not sure it's waiting in line for an hour good. Maybe if you're from Portland (those hipsters LOVE to wait in lines). I'm a hipster too, probably, it's a joke."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Food is good, but in my experience was not overwhelmingly better than most brunch places, at least not enough to warrant the long wait. The ambiance is also nice, but still felt as though I couldn't completely relax when so many people were waiting, especially when facing the window of the crowd outside. 

Also, ordered the chocolate pancakes which I was really excited about. When I finally tasted them, they were spicy, which is really interesting and presumably great for people who enjoy spicy food, but that's not really my cup of tea. Gave bites to other members of my party who agreed it was not just me. Nothing wrong with the dish, just wish the spiciness was specified."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been wanting to check this place out for ages - especially after having had brunch at the original location in Victoria several years ago - but we can't really do the whole ""line up for an hour and a half for a table"" thing anymore, with small children in tow. Luckily, I had the chance to go today, on a weekday, when the queue was fairly reasonable (~ 30 min). 

It was simply amazing. Everyone (six of us) loved their meals, without exception, and the service was very friendly, very efficient. The portions are massive, and was shocked not only by how much food I got for the price, but by how excellent the quality was. This is truly good stuff - not greasy spoon fare by any stretch. The menu is diverse and very creative. 

Requisite photo of my beautiful and insanely delicious meal, which I shall now dream about nightly until the next time I can dine at Jam :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great food worth the wait can't wait to come back when we are back in the area. Atmosphere was great breakfast was fabulous party of five and we loved all our meals.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Why do people line up for this place? No seriously. It's not bad I guess, but it's just large portions of slightly tweaked versions of breakfast standards covered in salty gravy and cheese or sticky sweet goo. There is much more interesting breakfast fare at Chambar mere steps away--with no line up!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Quite a long wait in line, but WELL worth it! One of the servers came outside to give us a time estimate, which we appreciated. I loved the inside decor, very clean. and the service was awesome! I had the cinnamon cream cheese pancakes, which were delicious. My boyfriend had The Harrison Fernando which he also thought was delicious and very filling. Portions were very large, we weren't hungry for the rest of the day! This place was an amazing find!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great place to brunch! The lines are usually very long so I prefer to go on weekdays rather than weekends. I've tried a few different things on the menu and have no complaints about any of them. The fries are v good and come in piles, so I'd recommend ordering something that comes with fries."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This place is definitely worth the wait! The atmosphere is nice and cozy. Service was prompt. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benny that was cooked to perfection. My friend and I shared the red velvet pancake with cinnamon cream cheese swirl and omg it was so delicious!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I had seen good reviews for this place so me and my wife decided to check it out. I had the French toast and fried chicken. The brioche bread was dry inside as it had not been soaked through. The fried chicken was over cooked and was like jerky. Not a fan of the sauce as it reminds me of sweet and sour. My wife had the farmers skillet which was was mediocre as it was a typical scramble. Bacon was soggy. Wanted to like the place.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"They had a line up outside when we came. Line moved pretty fast. But there's a policy, where all members must be on site to be seated. 

Pork belly Benedict, was gòooood. The poach egg was jiggling when the server brought it to us. Very pleased. Especially those hashbrowns, seasoned to perfection. 

Shared the Red velvet pancakes with my friend. The pancake is HUGE. The server was not joking when he told us it would be the size of a cake haha. The pancake batter was mmmm so fluffy. But a little overdose on the cream cheese drizzle and more cream cheese in the middle. Had to scrape off quite a bit of it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I am a sucker for small cafes, with that ""local"" feel to them. 
Ps: this place reminded me of home, ""The Nest"", during vacation. 

The service is great. Food is good, nothing too memorable. However, their drinks are delicious and the decor is pretty cool."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brunch in Vancouver can be a religious event for some people... popular restaurants often draw lineups that stretch down the block. While I've never been one to put up with excessively long lineups, I do enjoy me some brunch.

Jam Café is one of the more recent darlings in the brunching community. Interestingly, it's located at the former site of Café Medina, which also drew in big crowds. Is this restaurant located at some kind of nexus for magical brunch happenings? Or is that just a coincidence?

I arrived on a Saturday morning, just after 8am, and managed to find the last seat at the crowded bar. To say this place was busy is an understatement. While I waited for my meal to arrive, I sipped on this large mug of Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream ($4) and admired the mix of white brick, subway tiles, and wooden planks which made up most of the decor.

I wound up ordering the Chicken French Toast ($15) which arrived with buttermilk fried chicken on top of brioche french toast drizzled with tobasco honey and jalapeño sour cream, tomatoes, pickled cabbage and green onions.

The chicken had a tremendous crunch on the outside but the breast meat was slightly dry. I tried to compensate for this by drizzling more of the syrup on top as well as some of the green hot sauce that they have on the table. Overall, the food wasn't bad but I didn't see a real reason why the lineups are so long here. By the time I had left, there was a long line of people waiting in the rain."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long, long line! Second time here and the first time about an hour wait and this time the wait was about hour and a half. The line must speak for itself lol. For me it's good. It's a must try for yourself kinda place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came here in a Friday at 12:30.  The line was out the door and the wait was 1.5h!  We were starving but since we already paid for parking and we were set on eating breakfast, we stayed.  We were so glad we did.  The foods were out of this world!  Almost everything on the menu looked tempting.  Great customer service!  We never felt rushed even though they had a line outside.  Even though we came in hungry, we still had a hard time finishing our foods since the servings were so huge.  We'll be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Pancake portions - you will laugh so hard....THEN realize you have to eat that hahaha. The portions are ridiculously large we shared the red velvet amongst 7 people and had left overs

Chicken and waffles - chicken was moist and yummy, waffle was okay could have been crispier
The big charlie - i tasted it, its ok to me, everyone else at the table loved it. I think its dependent on whether you like sausage gravy? I'm so-so about it.

Line - ridiculously long, would I have waited again? probably not."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My fiancé and I were in Vancouver several weeks ago and when we travel we like to eat breakfast. Jam caught our eye on Yelp and on our way we were. Upon arriving we saw there was a line that wasn't too long. It took about 15-20 minutes to be seated. The menu was posted on the restaurant window, so we were already drooling when we sat down. 

The first thing that caught my eye was the blood orange mimosa. 10:00 AM? on a Friday? Why not? I'm on vacation! Two mimosas later my buzz was perfection. I decided on the chicken french toast and my significant other ordered the gravy coup. Both amazing selections. The fried chicken was juicy and well seasoned. The syrup had a kick to it and somewhere in between there was some flavored sour cream. 

On top of the great food, the service was awesome too. Smiling and friendliness goes a long way."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is fine, but do not go on a week-end!! The line ups are insane and they manage it really badly! Unless you're a party of two, then they'll make you skip the line. 

Waited 1 hour and 45 minutes, NOT WORTH IT.

The host told us ""don't worry your table is paying now you'll be inside in 5"". 30 minutes later we are still outside because the staff lets people hang out at the table once finished...with a line up outside of over 80 people....really bad management."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of my favorite breakfast places in the lower mainland. Try the chicken and waffles and always good specials. 

Expect a really long line, but worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is always packed and after trying it ... planning an 8 am seating on Victoria Day ... I know why people keep coming back.  

I attended the experience with a date for my b-day and I must say the atmosphere was energetic and not chaotic.  

Our server was awesome and was extremely polite and had a very short and appropriate conversation with us through out our seating.  

We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Strawberry and Banana Bianchi French Toast.  

The fried chicken was tasty, a bit dry, but the gravy made it ok.  The waffles were crisp, but soft inside.  Very good.  

The French Toast was loaded.  A bit too sweet for me, but it was still loaded with flavors with very fresh fruits ... well ...strawberries were fresh tasting.  I don't usually think bananas are supposed to taste fresh in breakfast dishes ... but they were nicely done on this dish.  

I really enjoyed Jam Cafe, it was clean, comfortable and the service was EXCELLENT.  I usually check out the washroom and stuff ... but I guess I was having too good of a time.  

Totally recommend!  =P"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is perfection! 

There was a line when we arrived at 9 AM but was seated within 20 minutes. The decoration and atmosphere was really nice and relaxed. We were greeted and served fairly quickly without a long wait for food. There are no words to describe how amazing the food tasted. We ordered the Herald Street omelette and the Brioche French Toast. The serving size for both entree was very generous. The omelette tasted fresh with quality ingredients and the french toast was not overly sweet and did not need extra syrup, but can be added if you desire. The food was not greasy and tasted great!

I will definitely return on my next visit to Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've only been here twice.  Long lineups makes me think twice about coming here.  But both times it was only 1/2 hour wait and I came here at a supposedly slower time of day.  This is the only reason it's a four start and not five.  Food here is outstanding as is the service.

I love the brunch bowl.  It think it's the mushroom sauce that makes it so good.  It's quite a lot of food so come hungry.  The place is tight and I don't advise baby buggies.  It's also loud.  There are lots of knick knacks throughout the restaurant and it makes you feel like you're in a barn with refurbished relics, kind of cool.  I don't think they do take outs because it's too busy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We wait for about 20-25 minutes to get seated. It was really busy and I know why many people are willing to line up now!

So, this is my first time trying benedicts. Its perfectly cooked! And that sauce on top, plus their own style of hashbrown, i certainly love it!! My sisters got the Chicken French Toast and the Little Charlie. It's my first time seeing fried chicken with French Toast so i found it quite creative. The Little Charlie taste very good too. Everything just taste right!

Their service was super nice, we really did have a good time there! Will definitely go back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Another place that needs to get the NoWait app, as people are lined up outside for an hour.  This place is great for traditional type breakfasts, eggs and the like. We got the French toast as well as chicken in the coop; chicken biscuit and egg.  It was worth the wait; portions are large!  Had to take some of the leftovers home.  The chicken in the coop was cooked well, but nothing too memorable. This place is small but works like a well oiled machine. Service is excellent."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Keyword to Jam Cafe's success is - CONSISTENCY. This is where honest, good breakfast is.

Order the Gravy Coop with the gravy on the side and fried chicken - you won't be disappointed! The chicken is moist and juicy, the coating is crisp, the biscuit is buttery soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Hashbrowns are the traditional ""shredded"" variety - no pretending of roasted diced potatoes as ""hashbrowns"" here - and pan fried to golden goodness. Coffee is railtown from JJ Bean - a dark mellow blend with no acidity, in other words, awesome.

The only down side is of course the wait. But the food comes out quick. For parties of 2 - 4, be prepared to wait 30 - 40 mins. But very much worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam cafe had pretty good food. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was nice, and I had an enjoyable breakfast."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Really liked the food. They have a few unique dishes like the biscuit melt and the bowl with eggs biscuit and mushroom gravy. Will definitely go back
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Jam cafe is your classic breakfast joint. The Carlie bowl is perfect for anyone with a big appetite. There is always a huge line down the block so come early.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Heard a lot of great things about Jam Cafe and wanted to see if it was true. Wanted in line for around 1 hour in rain and would have wanted 2 hours as food and service was AMAZING! While waiting the owner ( I think) came out with a tray of waffles for people to try which I thought was an exceptional customer experience and ordered when we got in as an appetizer. A must stop for any foodie while in Vancouver!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,A great brunch restaurant! nice staffs and delicious brunch. I definitely will go back there.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Long wait but the food was really good!  The server was a bit rush rush though which made the breakfast super uncomfortable.  Otherwise try it out :)!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Excellent breakfast!  They lines may be long, but it is well worth the wait.  The portions are huge.  I had the chicken fried steak and it was awesome."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here with my friends yesterday because of all the hype that has been going around about this restaurant. I do believe that they lived up to their reputation! We came around 10am and waited approx 40-45min or so. Usually I would have left because I hate waiting in line, but I'll tell you now that it is worth the wait. I ordered a half Beni with the sugar cured bacon and it was delicious! The hollandaise sauce was great and it wasn't too heavy. The hash and fruits that came with it was also yummy and completed the meal well. It was a good portion for its price too. 

The service was pretty good as well considering how busy it was. They refilled my water twice and came to check on us a couple times as well. Will definitely come back to try more things on their menu."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's a lot of carbs. Biscuits. Gravy. Hash browns. If you want a heavy cheese carbs bfast, go. If you want healthy and light, this is not your place. There was a full line before 8 AM on a Friday morning."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Get here early. There was a line for a reason! Tasty brunch/breakfast. The cocktails were delicious (my husband and I had to come back twice to try more of them). The food was delicious- definitely large portions.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We arrived at about 1:15pm on lovely Saturday afternoon, and had to wait about 45 minutes. I think it's easier if you have a smaller group, to get seated. We snagged some bar seats, which ended up being the best spots in the house! 

The bartender/beverage mastermind was very friendly and confident. She was always very aware of what her bar customers were doing and watching, and offered up tidbits of information -ie. ""this is the Bourbonator!!"" or ""this is the Vietnamese iced coffee"" when she noticed us observing her work. She was kind enough to give us some complimentary milkshake samples to share. Unfortunately we were both allergic to lactose and we only took a few polite sips. I have to say, she really made our experience special! 

My friend ordered the Chicken French Toast, which came beautiful presented; bright vibrant magenta cabbage on top of some delicious looking toast! She paired it with an iced coffee that our bartender was able to make with the syrup on the side. I had the Little Charlie and please believe the reviewers below when they say the Little Charlie is still more than enough for one person!! I could only finish a quarter of the bowl, but holyyy was it amazing! Comfort food in a bowl.... this is what I would eat on a cold, rainy day, or if I was feeling sad, because it was chock full of spongy biscuits, hash browns, runny eggs, ham and this delicious gravy. Wow!!! I loved this dish so much! 

The restaurant's interior is very chic and hipster, totally fitting into the gastown vibes. The servers all seemed very friendly and down-to-earth, none of that snotty service you would get at high end restaurants. I highly recommend Jam Cafe on Beatty for a nice brunch, but make sure you come early!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Besides having to wait outside in the cold rain, it was a great experience! The pancakes were the best I've ever had. Texture and flavor was spectacular. The atmosphere was cozy. They even gave me a blanket. I got the salmon on toast and a side of a pancake. It was a lot of food. Very big portions!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait line is really long. The food was good but some dishes have bigger portions than usual, so make sure you ask waiter before order. The services are really nice and fast. The atmosphere is really cozy and friendly. The menu has a lot variety of food to choose from. It is good place to go for breakfast or lunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,A brunch spot that bows how to do it right! The food and mimosas were amazing. Please add a second location on The Drive so I can eat here more often.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited outside 45 minutes in order to have breakfast here and it was well worth the wait. Not to mention the manager came out and allowed us to sample the waffles which were delicious!This place has a nice vibe, great food and friendly staff. We can't wait to visit again next time in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place really lived up to the hype! Both of our meals were excellent and from what we saw of other orders, they looked great as well. I ordered the Charlie bowl, delicious, just what I look for for a breakfast feast. If you order the full order, bring your appetite, it's huge! My wife ordered banana walnut pancakes and I snagged a few bites. They had great flavor and and texture. We may may have to stop by one more time before we leave."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I would give this place a 4.5 stars for a strange reason, which is that the serving size for the Charlie Bowl and the Veggie Bowl was so large to the extent that I barely could make a dent in it. I ordered the small version and it was STILL obscenely large and definitely were more for sharing. I don't like food waste and it seemed like the waitress was aware that the portions are just too big. BUT otherwise the food was absolutely outstanding and the staff was so helpful. Great tip: it opens at 8AM every day for breakfast but we got there at 8:10 and had to wait on line for 20 minutes. This place is hoppin but it's 100% worth it, a must-visit for sure!!! Also we didn't order them but there were these cinnamon pancakes that looked amazing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait is worth it and the hype is real! 

Had the brioche French toast with apples and it was perfectly sweet. Hubs had the fried chicken eggs benny and it was delicious."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,LOVE everything but the line ups. If they had more seats / another location to alleviate that it bumps up to 5 stars right away. The food is awesome !
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really had a good time there. The food is a little on the heavy side, but it's tasty. The staff is nice. We ordered 3 dishes to share between 4. You do need to go early to beat the rush though otherwise be prepared to be in line.

Came here for a second time. I still stand by my review"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Went here twice while in vancouver. Such a pleasant surprise. Found on yelp due to reviews and they were correct. Servers are vivacious and fun. Menu is large and quality is great.   You must try the jam.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I can make better French toast than them. The server Angela was not very friendly. The music was good. Mimosa was ok. They have other plates that look fine. May give it another try.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I cannot comment on the quality of the food..since we never actually ate there..they do not take reservations. On a Sunday morning it was a one hour wait, and when we didnt want to stand in the cold for that long..On Monday I called before and asked how long the wait was.. told 20 minutes...when my husband and I got in line an impeccably rude hostess came in front of us and a few others and literally yelled it's going to be another 45 minutes and seemed really annoyed..that was the biggest deterrent yet ( instead of maybe giving us a menu to look over)..we walked right next door to chambar...hostesses seemed relieved..awful customer service out front."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely as good as the reviews you've read.  

For some odd reason, we did not have much of a wait for a weekday breakfast for a family of five, but just as soon as we arrived, a huge line began to queue behind us, so be prepared to wait.

The ambience is adorable, the service is fantastic, but the food (quantity, preparation, presentation) is the star."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Be prepared for a bit of a wait, but the food definitely was well worth it.  The portions are enormous, so be prepared to leave full. Definitely enough to share. My husband and I tried the Chicken French Toast and it was was a really tasty and unique dish. We also tried the Harrison Fernando which was also delicious and a hefty portion. All ingredients were fresh and well prepared."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Heard that this gem from Victoria has opens its door in Vancouver, how can I not come and give it a try?!

We arrived around 1:30pm and waited half hour for our table. The cafe is at the old cafe medina location, and they have completed renovated the inside to display a rusty feel. 

We ordered the little Charlie, red velvet pancake and the Harrison Fernando. The lady recommended to downsize the pancake for us, which was a wise choice. The portion here is huge and I could barely finish the little Charlie! The buttermilk biscuit is very buttery, almost a little too buttery to a bit heavy side. The combination of ham, biscuit, cheese and fried eggs were spot on. I can have the little Charlie bowl everyday. The spicy sausage with gravy and buttermilk biscuit in the Harrison Fernando were also a champ. The red velvet pancake is a little undercooked, just a few more second on the stove would be perfect! It's more like a thin cake than pancake. The icing paired with maple syrup were perfect for the pancake though!

Overall it is definitely a winner. I would come back and line up again for another great brunch."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Our friend recommended us to eat here and we waited for 40 minutes on a Tuesday around 10. Unfortunately, it was not the worth the wait for us. 

I asked the waitress what was the most popular ordered food and she said anything with fried chicken. I ordered The Gravy Coops which was 16.5. I had the choice of buttermilk fried chicken, chorizo, fried pork belly or portobello mushroom. It was two sunny eggs served on a buttermilk biscuit (which was dense and dry) with a side of hash browns and mushroom gravy. I would say the mushroom gravy was the highlight of the meal.                                                                                                                   

My friends bowl was a more appetizing but I don't believe it was worth the wait, especially on a Tuesday morning."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Our family loves Jam Café! We go here for our celebration brunches because it definitely is a treat. Mom usually goes for the Gravy Coop: the chicken is juicy, the biscuit - buttery and flakey. Add to that some eggs made to your liking, crispy hashbrowns, and savoury gravy and you've got all the components for a perfect bite! Myself and my brother cannot get enough of their pork belly, and always get a couple extra on the side - it's crunchy and the meat is just so tender...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 
Their mocha is also quite yummy; a nice warm drink to wash all that yumminess down. 

Be prepared for a long line-up but it's worth it. Outstanding service as well: when they found out that one of us was celebrating our bday, they sent over some complimentary amazing cinnamon swirl pancakes. And this happened more than once :) :) :) 

Come for a visit, you'll be glad you did!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This place has great food and great service friendly staff environment is nice good brunch and breakfast
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Pretty good. Arrived at 1.45 for a late lunch. Had to queue for about 10 minutes. Very fast and efficient service. They serve breakfast and lunch all day so there is plenty to choose from. I ordered the veggie bowl. It was good, not great but very, very filling. I could only eat half of my order. I noted many people getting their leftovers packaged up for taking away. I probably only again just to try something else on the menu but wouldn't queue for more than 10 minutes."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is easily one of the best brunch places I've been to. Except to wait in line though but it'll be worth the wait. My go to is always eggs benny, their hollandaise sauce is so freakin' delicious I want to put it on everything. Their red velvet pancakes though is an absolute must. It's not too sweet but you can definitely taste the red velvet part to it and the cream cheese frosting just tops it all off, it's perfect!! You also must try their iced coffee, it's sweetened with condensed milk so you know it's going to be good. I wish they offered it in different sizes cause I would definitely get a large size to go."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is a hot new restaurant!  I went for brunch on a Friday afternoon and I still had to wait 20 mins outside in line. Jams is a small restaurant. I say it seats maybe 40 people at most.  

I had the chicken and waffles. It was pretty good. The meat gravy they serve really makes the dish. 

I think there's a big build up for this place. It's not bad at all, but it's not the be all and end all!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breakfast ever! Get there early. Warm decor. Green eggs and ham was enough food for two. Delicious pesto eggs on a flaky biscuit, some fruit, hash browns...perfect! Great coffee!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I finally tried Jam Cafe after being discouraged by the line up half a dozen times before. We arrived around 8:45 and the wait for two people was no more than 30 minutes. 

My partner and I ordered the Gravy Coop and the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict. Both were very good. The gravy was not too heavy, the eggs were soft poached (as requested) and the fried chicken was crispy and moist. Good portion sizes - very filling. 

Service was attentive. Cool decor, comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Overall a great experience and we will return in the future to try the other menu items."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Our go to brunch place on the weekends. My husband favourite is the Pork Belly Benny, while I opt for the Fried Chicken French Toast. Actually the whole menu is good. Portion are big, most patrons share. Get there before they open if your not into waiting in line for hours. And the line never ends till closing time. They do not take reservations. First come first serve. Luckily they will be opening up a bigger and more seating at the new location on 4th ave soon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Never disappoints and incredibly flexible, delicious menu! Chicken & waffles, pulled pork waffles, and so much more!! Big portions too!! (Had to doggy bag it)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Visited Vancouver for the first time, came here after I landed, and waited in line for 45min. The wait is worth the hype. That's all I've gotta say."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"While the food was tasty, it smelled slightly like a shit. As if, the cook took a shit and wiped it with the pan the cooked my eggs Benedict with. Personally, I believe that food should not smell shitty, but instead like a flower fart. End of review. God Bless America"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Other than the wait, the food was just okay. I would say it is very creative and comfort food style rather than out of this world flavour. If you want to have huge portions and instagram worthy foods definitely recommend but as far as breakfast goes it's simple foods with a creative spin.

Had the Charlie bowl and for someone with a big appetite I couldn't finish it. Ended up taking 3/4 of it home. Granted they warn you how big portions are! I'd recommend for a casual morning where you aren't in a rush or for those mornings where you need the extra comfort."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Good food but terrible queuing process. We waited for 1 hour while it's snowing outside ! They simply can take names or provide buzzers to call people instead on waiting in a line to be seated !
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There are always line ups to this place.
I opted for a take away chicken sandwich. Was not disappointed"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went to Jam Cafe several times and it never fails my palette. I got the Little Charle Bowl and Eggs Benedict with Salmon the last times I went. The Charlie Bowl is very hearty with potatoes, hash, egg, ham and pork (I forgot). I always get the Jam Cafe coffee with my meal. It's a coffee mixed with condensed milk and whatever magic they put into it. 

The line ups are horrendously long so expect at least an hour wait or longer at peak hours."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Once a restaurant has a long line to get inside you know the place is good. The line went quit fast I had the chicken and waffles the chicken was a little bit to crispy but  was very tasteful. The scrambled eggs and the apple cinnamon filling was perfect. Great place to eat. That little cherry is fantastic.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely up to the billing.   Super nice staff, excellent food that is unique but not too exotic to enjoy.  I had the biscuit with pork belly and it was excellent.  Next time it's the pulled pork pancakes for this guy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Warning, your going to wait. But it is soooooo worth it. One of our favorite things to do in Vancouver is go out to breakfast when visiting our daughter at UBC.  We are always looking for the best of the best. Jam Cafe is it. Try the cinnamon pancakes, three pigs, Charlie Bowl or one of the Gravy Coops, anything!  Oh my gosh making myself hungry thinking about it.  Great service, great food, the line outside tells the story!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Hidden gem! This is an amazing place to buy your breakfast. Although it may be crowded all times this restaurant is worth the wait. Their service is great. Their food tastes amazing. Their Special Menu is fantastic. If  you are going to Vancouver need a place to get breakfast this is the place you should go. This ticks all the boxes, great food, great service and be prepared to eat a lot! Definitely be back again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I'll never know because the line is two hours long even on a rainy weekday and they don't let you leave your name and come back. No way this place is worth the wait. It's a tourist trap.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A wait for almost an hour for breakfast, on a Thursday morning seems a little excessive, but let me tell you... WAIT!!!!! It's freakin worth it!!!

We were between Medina and Jam, and chose Jam. Our friends ended up eating at both during their visit, and while they loved the waffles at Medina, they liked the overall meal at Jam more. 

I got a pork Benedict, but there were SOOOOO many things I wanted to try, and it was so hard to choose! My Benedict was relish though! Also ... mimosas........ yuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmm."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Foods are good but the line to get in the restaurant is extremely longwe waited for over 1.5hour. If you don't mind a long waiting time, try it. Recommend ""three pigs""."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We did it! We found a negative...


...The staff TOTALLY took our napkins before finished.  That's it. That's the ONLY negative. Ok the line was long but we chatted with others and made the most of it. 

All seriousness sorry to add to the hype but this was by far the best breakfast we've ever had. We are from San Francisco/San Jose and this tops anything we've had there. That is a foodie area so that is saying a lot. 

We had the Brioche French Toast and the Pork Belly Benny. Both were amazing. Great chutney on the Benny balanced sweet with the savory. 

Get the cider. Fantastic. 

Try their jalapeno hot sauce. Home made and delicious. 

We will be recommending to friends visiting the area."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good, maybe not worth the wait? We waited more than an hour to get in on Saturday morning. I'd go back for sure during a quieter time. Coffee was good. Little expensive - a mocha and the breakfast special was about $21. Highly recommend the veggie bowl."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Damn Jam cafe! You have served me well today. I had the Herald street omelette with cheese, chorizo, mushrooms and tomatoes. The meal it self was very filling and the restaurant was ""jam"" packed. Thanks for the good times."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Just like everyone says - fantastic breakfast spot. We got there at 8:30 on a Wednesday morning and had to wait about 20 minutes to get in. It was totally worth it.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food and service makes it all worth the wait. I recommend the egg benedict dishes as they're sooo good and fill you up the right amount.My friend had a generous portion of chicken french toast but I found it to be a little too sweet for my tastes.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food at this place totally lived up to expectations! Not to mention when one of my orders that came out was not particularly to my liking they took it away and came back with a brand new order! Fantastic service and the food was incredible. 

The only downside is that there is quite a long wait, which is fine in good weather but I cannot imagine waiting in the rain or the snow. Also because there is such a long line when you do finally sit down its not as relaxing as most places because you feel the need to rush through your food to let other people come in and enjoy as well. Or maybe thats just me. 

Either way, the food was phenomenal along with the service and totally worth the wait for me! 

Will definitely be going again...maybe just wait for a sunny day ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is toooo good! The wait is worth it! Don't believe me, just check out the pics! Get it all!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing breakfast, little bit of a wait, but worth it! Best breakfast this trip!!! Love the canadian maple syrup."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great breakfast buta long lineup. Great fresh food. Enjoyed it but it can be crowded.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waited for over an hour on a Sunday and it was well worth it. This place is awesome. Our server was sooo nice, made conversation with us and gave us some good suggestions. The restaurant is decorated so cute and I can't think of one thing that I didn't like about this experience. THEIR BACON IS AMAZING! There were four of us and we all got different things to eat & drink and no one was disappointed. Brunch is my favorite, and I don't know that I've had a better brunch than this. Our next trip to Vancouver will absolutely include a stop here. Highly recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We ordered the cinnamon pancake (amazing!!!), the veggie bowl (incredible taste but it's huge so I recommend getting the 1/2 bowl for 1 person), biscuit sandwich (would've been better with a side of mushroom gravy), coffee (not so great). We can on a Sunday for brunch and waited about an hour for two of us to sit but it was totally worth it! Overall the food was amazing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went here for the first time in October. BEST EGSS EVER. I seriously don't know what is different about their eggs, but they taste delicious.

They also make this green sauce that my boyfriend loves, and they also sell it!

Staff was very friendly, and the place can get pretty busy which doesn't alter their attitudes! Next time I'm in Vancouver I'll definitely be going back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One year after my last visit and they still use their old wait system. You will have to wait in line wether it's below freezing (like in our case) or raining. Simple solutions like taking people names and ask them to come back could be done (just like Medina cafe) but they said "" this process takes time"" really!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had pretty low expectations for this place given Vancouver's habit of over-hyping brunch places. However, they definitely delivered. They flipped their tables quickly so I only waited for maybe two minutes, although this is on a weekday at around 130 so not sure what it would be like at other times. The wait staff is attentive without being annoying. 

Now for the food, I ordered the brioche French toast with cinnamon apples. I don't take this lightly, but this is the best French toast I've ever had. The crust was still crunchy and the inside were soft without being ""eggy"". I have a sweet tooth and it was *almost* too decadent for me to finish alone, so I recommend sharing with someone if you can. 

All in all, I'll definitely be back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Always a good place to eat with friendly service! Just remember to come early to avoid long waits outside!! & all your party members have to be there before you are seated.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One star for not having a good system of making people wait. When the weather is cold and raining. I wish they can take your name and text you when it is your turn to get a table!

We waited for 1 hour and 40 minutes in the rain.

I am not coming back because of this."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Despite the wait (we waited 35 mins at 8AM on a Thursday), the food and service was amazing and worth the wait! I will definitely be going back to try other dishes."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! The fried chicken eggs benny, red velvet pancake and french toast with strawberry banana was so good, I'm still thinking about it after 2 days! 
The service was great! I would definitely go back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I love coming here for brunch! Their service is amazing and superb, so patient and super friendly. I recommend to come earlier than 10:30 because the line ups to get in can be pretty long but trust me the wait is much worth it! I love bennies and they have a great section of bennies. My favorite is the pork belly and fried chicken. They have yummy french toast too, oh so good. I haven't tried any other things on their menu, but I'm sure they are just as good. Everything is reasonably priced, not too expensive. Their bourbanator caesar is delicious, and so is their lavender lemonade. Overall always a great experience coming in, and will always continue to do so."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Love this place ! 
The service was great and the food excellent .. 

The atmosphere is warm and cozy 

I had the chicken and waffles with sunny side up egg and gravy $16 
And shared the red velvet pancakes .., heaven   
Big portions .. I got the butter maple syrup at the side for my waffles yum 

It is busy so expect to wait for a table .. My friend and I were lucky to get a table quickly"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Some quick Yelp searches in the area brought my attention to this eatery, and I sure am glad it did. 

We got there on a Saturday morning around 11AM, and there was already a line that stretched along the block. It took us about an hour and then some to get in, but the staff was so friendly that the wait didn't seem too bad. The staff gave umbrellas out to those that didn't have one and they even walked down the line carrying complimentary warm waffle strips!

To start us off, we ordered a couple of alcoholic beverages because we were on vacation and thought, ""why not?"" I got the morning fog, and my girlfriend got what turned out to be a spiked hot chocolate. The drinks were a little on the watery side, but it had a nice warm buzz to it that felt good after escaping the cold drizzle outside. 

My girlfriend and I ordered the sweet potato fries to share, an order of the pork belly benedict and the fried chicken benedict. Honestly, the food was absolutely amazing. The pork belly came with a homemade onion jam that tasted like spread grilled onion goodness. The pork had a nice crispy exterior with a warm, juicy and fatty interior. The fried chicken was juicy and tender, and it came with a delicious corn salsa. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the english muffin had a good toast to it too.

The next time I come to Vancouver I'm going to make it a point to stop here again, and you should too! There's so many tasty items on the menu that it definitely warrants a repeat trip."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is probably my favourite brunch place. Although there is usually a line to get a seat, the food will definitely make up for waiting outside in the cold. Tip: come earlier if you don't want to wait too long! 

I came here with 3 of my other friends and the food was magnificent. The portions are very big, so we decided to order 5 items to share so we can get a taste of different foods (yes, it was definitely way too much food for 4 people, but still worth it!). We ordered The Three Pigs, Smoked Salmon Benedict, Chicken N' Waffles, Red Velvet Pancakes and one other thing I don't remember the name of. Each of them was amazing, but The Three Pigs was definitely my favourite. The Chicken N' Waffles were good, but I'm not a huge fan since I don't like mixing sweet and salty foods. The Red Velvet pancakes we treated as dessert, and it was a perfect end to our meal. 

The servers are very friendly, and the place is quiet cute. I just wish that it was a little bigger, since it feels a little packed inside. However, the ambiance and furniture definitely makes you feel at home."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"good place. This place makes you realize that quality food is worth the money and time.
Big portions!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Very long line but the wait is very much worth it. The food here is incredible! The Charlie was amazing but unless you plan on taking some home with you, I suggest getting the smaller serving!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Charlie Bowl and Green eggs were delicious and large portions. I recommend choosing the half or small order unless you plan to share. Not a big fan of queuing up outside but it's worth the wait. Blood orange mimosas were a hit at our table
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's very good . The food is very delicious.I like the coffee very much,in case of adding the rum."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"You may be initially scared off by the lineup. That's ok. If you can wait (or show up right at the opening), you'll be treated to one of the most amazing breakfasts you've ever had. There are no bad choices on the menu, which makes it so much harder to choose, but their eggs benny and French toasts are unreal."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It has been absolutely my favorite!
A friend and I, we found it by causality.. We just followed our instinct and it was a wonderful discover."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The newest brunch kid in the neighbourhood! Great vibe and look and there's always a line up (except when I went 30 min before closing)! 

Their menu is interesting and they have great staff. This is the reason I'm giving them four stars. For food alone, I think it warrants more of a 3 to 3.5 stars.

What we ordered: 
Side pancake with banana and walnuts and warm maple butter - okay this was pretty much perfection on a plate. A massive side pancake the size of a dinner plate topped with caramelized bananas and walnuts smothered in warm maple butter. This was good, amazingly so. This pancake was everything, light and fluffy deliciousness. If you are ever debating if it's worth the $2.00 to get the warm maple butter, the answer is yes everytime. 

The gravy coupe - biscuit with fried chicken, sausage gravy, two fried eggs and hash browns. Honestly, I wanted to LOVE this. It has everything that one could ask for on a plate. Sadly, the biscuit was a bit dense and the gravy was bland. The potatoes could have spent a couple more minutes on the pan as they were pretty light and limp. 

Huevos Rancheros - the boy ordered this and said they were bland. 

All in all, some hits and missed but I would still go back to try some of their other brunch dishes!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great place for brunch! They have solid food here and everything is so delicious! Be warned that there is always going to be a line! My friends and I waited about an hour. Service is friendly and quick too.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My absolute FAVOURITE breakfast place in all of the lower mainland. I have tried so many places, but nowhere has the flavour, authenticity, service, etc that jam cafe has! I loveeee their bowls and the fried chicken egg Benedict. You can't go wrong with anything at jam cafe. Definitely recommend, the huge waits are worth it"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was a very long wait but very much worth the wait. I had the veg. Breakfast bowl and it was certainly a delicious breakfast dish, and it was definitely a different one, I haven't had such thing before. But I would definitely recommend sharing the bowl, , I could only finish 1/3 of it.
And then the stackable pancakes with the cream frosting and cinnamon, oh gosh, so good.
But I think it's a littlle pricy, i don't think it's a $$ cafe only, I think it deserves a $$$ sign. Also I don't like how they're using the space, yes they would want to accommodate everyone, but the tables are too close to each other."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So happy to see them open here.  I always go to the Victoria location when I am visiting. 
The Three Pigs are delicious.  The spicy sausage in the light batter with the fruit salad is my favorite. 
Thanks Jam Cafe for a great lunch.  The portions are really big so come hungry!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A bit of a wait to get in. Once you're in though, the staff are super friendly and extremely attentive. My coffee and water never went empty. 
I had the Farmer's Skillet and it was fantastic. 
Highly recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been here before so this was my send time. I got little Charlie, which obviously was not little at all! Charlie bowl is basically gravy, potato, eggs, and biscuit. It's good but I prefer gravy scoop personally cuz of fried chicken. Biscuit was really good as well. 
I'll definitely come back here!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious, filling food. Great coffee. 
There's often a line outside but it moves quickly. Definitely a good place to come in parties of 1-4. 
Hipster environment, house-made maple syrup!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It is worth the wait and believe me, there will be one. Get the brioche french toast with a side of bacon. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Food and service was phenomenal. We ordered the fried chicken eggs benny and the fried chicken and waffles. We had to substitute the sausage gravy for mushroom gravy which didn't help the fried chicken and waffles but both chickens were cooked to perfection. Waffles were amazing. Ordered side biscuits which were on point with the butter and jam. Eggs benny was by far my favorite. Also had a mimosa with peach and ginger that was pretty refreshing. Will definitely be returning tomorrow but be warned long lines to eat here but with food this good can't really hate
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious food, long wait. We waited one hour (1-2pm) for a table on a rainy Sunday. The food and drinks came quickly and the service was great. The portions are huge, all of us ended up taking the rest of our meal to go so the price was worth it. The Buffalo blue chicken sandwich-while delicious- was very messy/hard to eat."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ohhhh boy, what to say about jam cafe.  Its amazing.  I haven't had anything bad here.  No wait, that's wrong.  I've only had amazing things here is what I should say.  I've come here twice, the first time with mom whose a picky eater (and loved everything too) and the second with another person and mom (who had to come back).  We ordered the the little charlie the first time (regular the second).  Its such a great combinations of tastes and textures.  The crumbled biscuit is super easy to eat and adds a great feel to the eggs and ham.  The potatoes are supper fluffy and soft.  A must try if you're going here for the first time.  We also got the pulled pork pancake.  I'm normally not a huge fan of pulled pork, but they make it well at Jam cafe.  Its super tender, very bbq-y flavoured and moist.  so moist.  Last up was the fried chicken and biscuit.  Done great.  Chicken holds its crispiness for awhile (we ate this last) even when covered in the gravy.  Oh the gravy, i forgot to mention its probably something i'd just order in a glass to drink on a cold winter day.  Like now.  if you haven't been to jam cafe, you ain't jamming!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious food, superb service. Special shout out to Erica for chatting me up at the bar!! No wonder they have lines on weekday afternoons as well. I was lucky to get a bar stool, perks of eating alone! I had chicken Waffle with gravy.  It was an enormous meal and very tasty. The gravy felt too salty in the beginning but that was balanced by the sweetness of the waffle. If you need more sugar like me, they have syrup on the side. Next time I want to try their extensive selection of cocktails, too bad I had work to do today."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow, just wow!!!!! Came to Jam Cafe as it was within walking distance from my hotel and was amazed at how fabulous their brunch was. Initially upon arrival I was bummed out to find a line out the door at noon on a Monday but after eating one bite of the Little Charlie bowl, I realized I would have waited all day to try this delicious concoction! I was so glad the waitress advised me to get the little Charlie rather than the full size, wow is it a ton of food! Go here if you're ever in Vancouver, you definitely won't be disappointed."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went to Jam really wanting to love it! It came well recommended by many of my friends & the lines were always going out the door. 

Unfortunately, I found that the dishes were too heavy and included too many components. As a table, we shared the Red Velvet Pancakes and the Gravy Co-op. The pancakes were a bit dry and overly sweet, the Gravy Co-op seemed a bit mismatched. 

Overall, the ambience, decor and service of the restaurant were great! Would be a good spot to meet up with friends, but be prepared for expensive food and long line-ups!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My favourite brunch spot in Vancouver!

I recently visited Jam Cafe on Beatty street with some friends and had a very excellent experience! I was quite impressed and now it's become my go to spot to recommend to friends! Menu options were all so good, it makes it so difficult to decide. I would definitely recommend sharing dishes with friends so you get to try a bit of each! Service is absolutely amazing, the lovely staff make the experience even better. Right of the bat the kind hostess who greeted me right as I got there was so polite and charismatic. Even though there was a large wait time today, as it was the family day holiday, the hostess was so prompt and organized with getting everybody in. It is well worth the wait! Our server was very kind and cheerful as well, and recommended us her favourite items on the menu! I went with the chicken and waffles and it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be returning to order this specific dish again. All in all I had a great experience all around and will be returning soon!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"amazing place with awesome menu and great service.  I had the chicken waffles, my daughter had stuffed waffles with banana and nutella.  All was awesome.  Worth waiting in line for sure.  Would wait 90 minutes if I had to but fortunately we waited only 30 mins.  Just do it!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing and well worth the wait. Once you're past the 20-60 min wait in the sidewalk line, you're welcomed by the savory scents of cooked meat and cheese. I ordered the Little Charlie and it looked so good I ate it before I remembered to take a picture for this review! My server recommended ""anything with fried chicken"" so I added a size of fried chicago and it was great - well peppered on the outside, not oily, juicy on the inside. Highly recommended!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I personally do not like queuing or waking up early, so when my friend decided to check this restaurant out I had some pretty high expectations. We waited for about 45 minutes for a table so by the time we sat down I was starving. I had The Old Town Breakfast and it was a pretty standard offering. I probably should have ordered one of their signature dishes (like the Charlie Bowl) but I'm not a huge fan of biscuits. For me personally, I probably won't return only because I'm not huge on this style of food (heavy and greasy). I think this place is overhyped for what it is."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Finally decided to see what the constant lines were about, and wasn't disappointed! 

We thought we would be able to skip the line by going on a weekday, but that wasn't the case.  However, since the line was mostly groups and we were a table for two, we were lucky enough to get plucked from the line and seated before most of the others. 

Great music.  Great decor.  Great service.. AMAZING food!!!

I had the buttermilk fried chicken and French toast.  It was the best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant.  My favourite part was the extra thick bread that had the most satisfying fluffy texture. 

A+ meal.   Definitely worth the wait!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Vancouver is an absolutely wonderful city with some many wonderful places. It's no surprise some of the best restaurants I've ever been to are here. But there's a problem. I live in Burnaby. So many great restaurants are deep within the Vancouver city limits which means I'm either going to have to make a long, frustrating drive or make the long walk and hop on the skytrain. 99% of the time I'm not going to make that journey. I'm lazy and would rather settle for something close by. However, Jam Cafe is that 1% that I will always make that long journey for.

First of all, let me say that I love how small and quaint Jam Cafe is. It kind of works against it because it's such a popular place that since it's small there's always a huge lineup outside. But the small venue offers a much more intimate dining experience. I love the decorations. You feel comfortable and welcomed like you're in your own dining room. It's an incredible atmosphere you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else.

I've been here twice for breakfast and I can honestly say Jam Cafe has provided me with two of the best breakfast's I have ever had. First time I went I wound up getting the gravy coupe and it may have very well been heaven on a plate. The gravy was absolutely delicious. The biscuits were soft and flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly. And the chicken. My goodness the chicken is what made the whole breakfast absolutely divine. The second time I went I wound up getting the Chicken and Waffles and it was just as good as the gravy coupe. I really like the chicken. Whatever seasoning they use is some of the best I have ever had. 

The only real issue with jam Cafe like I said in my second paragraph is because it's such a small place that is incredibly popular you should expect to wait outside for a table for quite a while. Both times my wife and I went we wound up waiting in excess of 30 minutes. I don't have a problem with waiting, and Jam Cafe is certainly worth any wait but again, expect to be waiting for a while."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The lineups are worth it! I met a friend here for brunch at 10am on a Sunday, and the line moved quickly (maybe 20 mins or so). The staff were friendly and attentive, taking names and giving time estimates. Once inside, it's a relaxed atmosphere, but not a huge space. I had the red velvet pancakes - it's a giant serving! But super tasty - not too sweet (not quite cake for breakfast, haha). Definitely adding this one to my brunch list!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I am obsessed with Jam Cafe and wish I could eat there everyday. The food is delicious with generous portion sizes which allows you to have left overs enough for an entire second meal! The only bummer is that the cafe is small, and no reservations so expect to be standing in line for 45mins to an hour during busy times .... but the food is so good that it is so worth it! Order the Lone Piggy - pancake coated sausage with maple butter is YUMMMMYYY"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Heard about the Victoria, BC location, but unfortunately didn't get a chance to go to that one.  So when I was looking for a place to eat here in Vancouver, I was excited to see that there is a location here. Depending on what time of the day you come, there pretty much will be a line up of some sort, but when we were there, it didn't take us too long to get in.

My husband ordered the breakfast ""The Little Charlie""...which really is not little! The bowl was as big as my husband's face! Not to mention, it was a mound of food! We probably should've shared the Charlie. I'm starting to think that whenever we're in B.C. and want brunch, we should just share an order of food because most of their dishes are enormous. Regardless, I ordered the eggs Benedict with chorizo, which was a more reasonable size. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his Charlie bowl, although there was no way that he'd even be able to finish it. Everything was well put together and tasty! I loved my eggs Benedict because it was a nice spin with chorizo. The Hollandaise sauce was wonderfully creamy and delicious! We would definitely come back and try some of the other dishes, maybe even come back for lunch.

Considering how busy it is here, the place was full and the line up outside was getting longer, their service is quite good. They regularly come around to ask if you'd like a refill of coffee and to check to see if you are in need of anything. The waitresses were pleasant and helpful. Overall, it was a great experience and adds to the wonderful brunch experience that we keep having in Vancouver and he surrounding area. They really do know how to do brunch!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm normally not a fan of breakfast, but the food here was AMAZING. I ordered The Old Town Breakfast - scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and rye bread. It was filling and delicious. My husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and loved it. The coffee was excellent, and the service here was phenomenal!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The hype is pretty real guys. 

Came with a friend for brunch, and we ended up waiting in line for only about 20 minutes?
Inside is a little tight, but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy brunch place. We were looking at the menu starting while we were in line and I honestly had the hardest time choosing what to order.

Almost experienced my mid-midlife crisis trying to choose between the matcha pancakes (on the special menu) and the gravy coop. Ended up going for the gravy coop, probably got a few grey hairs. My friend chose the pulled pork pancakes, and I can say that that wasn't an easy decision either.

The portions are HUGE. I finished the chicken and one of the two biscuits and I honestly felt like a champ (#winning). My friend ordered the half order for the pancakes and she could only finish half of that so... 

Both were pretty delicious. I usually stay away from fried chicken because I don't like how greasy/tough it can be, but the chicken was perfectly fried and very tender. The gravy was delicious, and so was the biscuit. Zero complaints. The pulled pork pancakes were delicious too. Good balance of all the different flavours they put in. The pancakes were pretty sweet and went really well with the pork and cilantro and etc. 

I'm honestly just waiting until I can come back so I can try something else and be super satisfied."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The best place to have breakfast downtown. Just remember that you'll have to wait for at least 30 min
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So I tried the popular spot with my GF. We arrived at 9am on a Saturday and waited an hour to be seated. The service was fine but the space is small and congested. The food was very good however I can't come to grips if it's worth the long wait. I would definitely go again although I feel the restaurant is a wee bit ""Hyped""."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place didn't disappoint! We came early Saturday morning at 0800 to beat the crowd. The decor was cute and cosy. And it is definitely one of the cleaner breakfast/brunch joints in town.

We ordered the Old Town Breakfast and Chicken waffles. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were generous. Friends have recommended the pork belly and bacon, so of course we got both. I personally preferred the sugar cured bacon more as I found the pork belly a little dry.

Would definitely come back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is just insane! Unfortunately so is the wait, but that's what happens when your just that good. The staff and atmosphere are always great too. Please expand the restaurant asap!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Don't judge me on my excessive over consumption.  Went to Jam Cafe on a Friday morning at 9am.  Was anticipating a HUGE line up but was seated in about 15 minutes.  Note that by 10:30am when we left, the line up had at least 40-50 people in line.  Got seated in the corner by the window which I think was the best seat in the restaurant.  Our waitress, Andrea was a little cheeky (in a good way), cute, attentive and efficient...a great server. There was also one server who just kept people's water filled up. Great vibe, friendly other people in the restaurant.  We were gawking at other's food while we waited for ours.     Between two of us, we ordered The Farmer's breakfast skillet, The Gravy Coops with fried chicken and sausage gravy and scrambled eggs, Cinnamon cream cheese swirl pancakes, a side of pork belly and a Bailey's coffee.  Everything was delicious...and I mean everything.  I'd go back there in a heart beat.  This is my new favourite breakfast joint. A winning combo with food, service and vibe.  They are also going to be opening another location in November (hopefully) on 4th Avenue in Kitsilano.  Can't wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"For someone who despises waiting in long lines for restaurants, I wasn't pumped about the 1.5 hours we waited for a table at Jam...but then we ate. And it was friggin amazing. Best French toast of my life...And I have had a lot of French toast. My girlfriend's waffles were delicious too. I'm still in a food coma as I write this review. The service at Jam is also excellent. Everything just when you need it. Super friendly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Line-up is totally infuriorating.  Hate lining for food.  Use a reservation system!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This brunch spot is a Brunch Treasure. I had the Hash and it was enough for 3 people. It took about an hour on a Sunday to get in, but it was worth it. Jam has a hipster vibe and a welcoming tone. This is an essential spot for any length trip to Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I went for breakfast with a friend of mine. This place has a decent size dinning room but it was packed by 9 in the morning (they opened at 8:00 am). We waited for 20 minutes outside and the hostess brought us to our table. They have pretty much typical breakfast dishes on the menu and I ordered the Gravy Coupe. The dishes tasted good but I was a little disappointed. First, the sausage gravy was bland in taste and I could taste any sausage favor at all. Secondly, the fried chicken meat was dried and it tasted like it was re-fried to order. Lastly, the whole dish cost a bit much ($15) compared to our breakfast joints in Vancouver. Overall, it was not worth it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"July 1st, Canada Day - Brunch

The line? Long. Stretched from the entrance to Chambar. 
The wait? 1 hour 20 minutes, for two. 
It wasn't too bad when you got good company.

I was quite delirious, running on 3 hours of sleep. The hostess came out 4x to check on everyone and even brought out complementary liege waffles and coffee. Coffee was excellent and much needed. A+ for management.

We finally got seated at the bar. 

We settled with fried chicken eggs benny and brioche french toast. So impressed with how much food they give you! The french toast was good, albeit overly sweet. Usually I won't order something like that, but the dude next to me had it; it was so visually appealing, I had to have it too. I had a bite of my friend's chicken. It was dry. It came with shredded hash browns, which she said could've been more crispier. 

Honestly, I don't remember much about the food, because of how great of a time I was having. 
I was more focused on chatting with my friend and the waitress at the bar. Service was phenomenal - from moment we stood in line, to being promptly served, to the busser clearing our plates, to even the guy who answered the phone when I called to see if they were opened. The interaction with everybody made the experience, and is what gives Jam Cafe its charm.

The waitress at the bar was a doll. She's the reason why this place warrants 5 stars. 
So there were two bottles of pickled white asparagus. I've never had pickled asparagus before, let alone white asparagus. I asked her what were they for to which she said for caesars  and graciously offered me one. Then another after telling her it was amazing. She was genuinely so nice, engaging, and attentive for the entire duration of our meal that that alone is enough to have me back. In hindsight, I wish I've gotten her name so I can praise her even more to management.

So even though the food was a little lackluster and the line was crazy, I know that I left very satisfied."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is so worth the wait in line!!!!!!! Loved it very much! With so much great items to choose from, you won't be disappointed in anything you choose. Come hungry because its a good amount of food that you need to finish. Staff was so friendly and made the experience so much better. Recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Victoria, BC."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I've been there 3 times for family breakfast and both the quality of the food as well as the service were excellent. I love their breakfast with an egg in avocado. I would highly recommend this place for all my friends without any hesitation.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been to Jam Cafe a couple times now and the food and coffee never disappoints! I always order the Farmer's Breakfast Skillet with a side of avocado - it's quite filling for one person so I usually share or save the rest for lunch. The only downside to Jam Cafe is that there is always a long lineup, and quite pricey (but consistent with Vancouver brunch pricing)!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Although there was a line to get in and we stood on the rain, it was definitely worth it. The wait was about 20 minutes. Food portions were a food size and you definitely got your monies worth. The place is a bit tiny but it's cute. We were visiting but if we come back I wouldn't mind going ahain."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Even on. Wednesday morning this place had a line out the door. Nevertheless, it was worth it. Best breakfast I've probably ever had. 

Pro-tip: order double bacon, you won't regret it"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This place is great! I got the red velvet pancakes (ask for a half order of eating alone) and scrambled eggs and hash browns. The staff was so sweet. The ambiance is cool and I really enjoyed my time there.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious! Really big portions so i would suggest sharing. Had to wait 45 minutes but I would say it's worth it. I would recommend the bowl! That was my favorite out of all the items we ordered.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Called and was told that it was going to be a 35 minute wait. Came and seen a line out the door. Heard that it was a must in Vancouver so I waited. Waited in line for about 35 minutes and the hostess came out to inform us that it was going to be another 30 minutes. It ended up being another hour.. was seated and the place was really small and cramp. They provide blankets which is nice because I was freezing from the cold. Food was mediocre. Not worth the 1.5 hour wait.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This restaurant is well worth the wait. I would've given this place 5 starts if there was an electronic line management software being used to assist staff in notifying customers of wait time. 

Food:
Menu variety, presentation and quality of food is amazing! I would definitely wait in line again when I come back to Vancouver. A must visit."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went to try out Jam Cafe and waited in line for about 25 minutes on Thursday at 12 pm.  I ordered the veggie bowl.  The veggie bowl should be called the ""starch bowl"" because all it has is hashbrowns and pieces of bread in it.  For vegetables there was a diced tomato and half of a green onion.  Where's the vegetables?? 

Food was below average.  I couldn't finish this dish.  No taste at all, and was just a dense bowl of carbs.  

Won't be returning anytime soon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"When we arrived 10 minutes after opening for breakfast, the place was full and the line was a block long but it was worth the wait. There are breakfast dishes I've never seen before. They have a way mixing sweet and savory, blending them into tasty dishes. Big portions so share."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"What's the fuss about....? Queues for hours and the only thing I can see that you get in return is a massive portion.

I got the veggie bowl and while the flavours were nice, the portion was so big that the bottom half of the bowl hadn't been touched by the mushroom gravy and was so dry and not really palatable. 

Cocktails are nice and service is good. Worth an hour (if not longer) of a wait time? No way."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here after hockey practice with a group of friends to celebrate christmas.  It was a nice place, really busy and lines down the block even when we were leaving so get here early!  The food is pretty delicious and surprisingly filling!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I used to make it a treat that whenever I was in Victoria to stop by, but now it's right down the street from my place downtown! Love the gravy coupe (chicken on a biscuit) and that is my favourite dish to date. I've also had the Charlie bowl (too much savoury spice!!!) the eggs Benny (weren't super special), and French toast (good if you want sweet overload!)  don't get me wrong all dishes were delicious and HUGE portions, but I just liked the gravy coupe best. 

Also if I'm taking a friend who hasn't been before, I always ALWAYS order the red velvet pancakes. When they are brought out it looks like the size of a 8 inch cake I kid you not lol, and SO GOOD. 

wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, prices are good for what you get, no wonder there is a line out the door every day!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We love the food :) Worth the wait! We thought we have to wait over 1.5 hours but we were lucky that day we only waited 35 minutes. We take server's advice to ordered triple pancakes with banana walnut flavor after eating it my sister and I instantly loved it. We finished the whole thing in 5 mins. The portion is big as well :) I would definitely recommend this place!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We went on a Saturday morning and waited in line for about 45 minutes. The wait was definitely worth it. The food is delicious and everything is fresh. Fun atmosphere, quick service, and clean. We were seated in a cozy booth by the window and it was interesting to see all the people outside standing in line. Everyone outside is looking in and pointing at your food because it looks so yummy. There is a variety of traditional breakfast food and lunch sandwiches but they have some other choices aside from the norm. I recommend the Mac and cheese sandwich and pretty much anything else on the menu. Can't go wrong. So yummy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Socialize in the line. I waited 80 minutes but the time went quickly as we chatted while in line. Next time, I would take a folding stool to sit on... But, once we got inside, it was all a-okay. I'm not sure that some of the hype is worth it but the portions are as big as your head (if you have a giant head) and the food is yummy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I work right next to this place, and I'm gonna tell you right now that there is maybe a 5min window per day when there is no lineup.
I order it to go, walk pass everyone waiting in line and then eat my food close to the window so that people in the line up can see me and die a little.
It is very satisfying. Come hang out with me at work and I'll let you try it too :)

Food is great. Fried chicken benny is great, the chicken is so moist, you'll forget how awkward is to use the word moist.
Huevos get thumbs up as well

For the dessert, order nutella french toast, and moan loudly with pleasure so that people in the line up really hate you."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Is there an option for 6 stars?  Worth the wait.  Big portions.  Great flavor.  Charlie bowl was incredible.  Fire chicken was mouthwatering.  Our neighbor got the red velvet pancakes and it was so big I thought it was a prank.  The decoration was nice too.  Loved this place.  Best breakfast I had in a while.  Incredible.  Hit this place up.  ASAP.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe Beatty Vancouver quietly open doors recently at the old Cafe Medina location at 556 Beatty Street. Line ups start at 30 minutes without a grand opening party or media event. If you jam is brunch, there are over 7 types of egg benny, red velvet pancakes and veggie and charlie bowls that's bigger than your head! Shock factor alone will make you wait patiently for your meal. Plus, you won't need to take a ferry to try it! Why not?!

The breakfast diner is very Canadian with moose antlers, baseball catcher's mask, vintage items sourced from Victoria, a periodic table with brunch staples on the wall. Owners Jim Walmsley and Mike Deas-Dawlish has put a lot of renovation work into the space. You can barely trace it's previous predecessors here.

My morning wake up calls for an Americano. Straight up with a touch of cream. Brewed with JJ Beans coffee beans.

Red Velvet Pancakes 13.95: A decadent red velvet pancake that isn't too sweet. Drizzled with cream cheese icing. Remember to ask for extra icing! Otherwise, it gets kind of dry. Or I would recommend asking for some pancake syrup. The two also goes well together.

Little Veggie Bowl 12: The name is a little deceiving. We originally pictured a glorious salad bowl filled with seasonal greens. Instead this is a hash brown bowl. Hash with crumbled biscuits, hash browns (of course), peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, cheddar cheese topped with mushroom gravy then topped with two sunny side up eggs. Order the small bowl if you are planning on eating this yourself. Sharing between less than three people, don't even think about getting the big boy.

There are so many other things I want to try here at Jam Cafe Beatty - there just isn't enough stomach space. I have to remember to wear stretchy pants and book five workout classes right after. I'm looking forward to the Steelhead Benedict (two poached eggs, smoked Steelhead salmon with classic hollandaise over a toasted english muffin. Topped with capers & green onion); Fried Chicken Benedict (two poached eggs, whole fried chicken breast, classic hollandaise topped with roasted corn salsa over a toasted english muffin); and Chicken N' Waffles (waffle topped with a boneless buttermilk fried chicken breast, house made pork gravy, a sunny side egg, and green onions).

I'm greedy like that. Yup."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait time was BRUTAL...but it was worth the wait! Unfortunately you would have to stand in line as they do not take names or phone numbers down - total bummer! For a group of 5, we waited about 1.5 hours and we were all hangrey! After sitting down, they gave us a smaller table which only seats 4 people and I had to wait for about 5-10mins before they could find me another chair. 

Good service and the food was quick to come out. The portions was amazeballs so our tummy was satisfied. To be honest, the price is reasonable for the portion sizes. Overall...everyone walked out happy and glad that we waited for that long.

I would most likely go back again but try to avoid going on a stat day! I would recommend this place for anyone to go."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went to Jam for the first time and the food was amazing.  Loved the red velvet pancakes (more like a dessert than breakfast).   

Only thing that I did not enjoy was the wait in line to get into the place.  It took about an hour to get in, but well worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,My favorite brunch place in the city! The service and food are great on both points. I highly recommend the pork belly benny!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The line seemed long, but we only waited for 20-25 mins. The atmosphere is very warm and homey, our waitress was so upbeat and nice! We ordered red velvet pancake and the charlie bowl. Honestly, the red velvet pancake was a little doughy and I didn't like it very much as my breakfast. BUT the Charlie bowl was AMAZING!! All the ingredients go well together, tastes healthy and not too heavy or oily. Oh, and their hot sauce is so good. They sell their hot sauce separately so if you loved their hot sauce, grab a bottle! :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great service, charming decor. We had the eggs benedict and the charlie bowl. Eggs benedict was perfect, very tasty! Charlie bowl is a heavy one, with bread and potatoes and cheese and 2 eggs, etc. The bigger charlie bowl is good for two people, complete meal! I recommend taking the small one and choosing something else though, that way you get to try more things on their menu. We were originally just gona grab a ""small breakfast"" because we had lunch plans. We ended up cancelling lunch because it was so filling lol"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"For the long wait, I would say the food was only OK. The fried chicken and fries was indeed very good but we did not like out chocolate waffle...couldn't pick up again after one bite... It felt under cooked... Drinks were good and authentic, paired with the interior, nice atmosphere. If the wait wasn't so long, I would have been fine."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food and service were outstanding. I ordered the chicken waffles and would definitely order the same food again. The sauce was just right for my palate with a perfect combination of saltiness and sweetness. The sauce was perfect for both the chicken breast and the waffles. Although I don't know for sure but the sauce was fatty and just right for my #ketogenic diet. I ordered a half avocado to add to my #keto requirements for the day.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Waits, yes. Extra wait if more than 2 yes, that's annoying. Is it worth it Hell yes ! Been here more than a few times and consistently great food, presentation and service . Worth the wait, even in the rain."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long wait at 10:00 on Saturday before New Year. Devoted fans and many newbies such as myself get great breakfast/brunch food as reward for their patience.Super busy but the staff are great and have time for you. Pancakes looked good but I can't have them (have to be Gluten Free). I had the boring ham and eggs, only it was a slightly new take. I think they have their take on bloody Marys also, but I had a blood orange mimosa - or two -that worked for me. Plan your visit to minimize wait time, but unless you're immune to breakfast -- do visit."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Amazing food and the interior design is very interesting. The restaurant actually changes menu from time to time therefore you won't be bored. One note to take: be prepared for an hour wait time on side walk if you can't make it before 10:30am on the weekend.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Awesome atmosphere and amazing food. Huge portions and Great prices for the portion you get. The staff is really friendly
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here on a Wednesday and was sat down immediately. If you don't mind a long wait, definitely stick it out to try this place. Servers were friendly and eager to answer any questions. 
The FOOD: best brunch in the city for an even better price."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Cute breakfast place with great food and service! I love breakfast and am always on the hunt for great breakfast places in the cities I visit, and this is definitely a winner for me. We ordered the green eggs and ham, old town breakfast, and a pancake which were all cooked to perfection! The staff members are very friendly and attentive which is awesome. If you're looking to try this place out come as soon as they open! They are jam packed as soon as those seats fill. I will definitely be back the next time in town."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great breakfast spot with delicious omelettes -- if you have time to wait in line. And wait. And wait. Typically I go alone and even so, there is still a considerable wait each and every time, no matter the day of week or time. Other items look and smell fantastic but Jam is one of the only places I can get the omelette I want and so I order the same thing every time. Their onion jam is delicious! Mimosas are good too. Food comes out relatively quick once you order. Small space and can be noisy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is absolutely my favourite place to eat. I'm just so sad it always has a line up. Get there earlier than you intend to eat. And try to show up not starving or bring snacks. You can't simply leave the line up and grab a coffee, you have to physically wait in line. Many times I have gone and then decided to eat somewhere else. Charlie bowl is hhhuuugggeee only get the mini. The cinnamon swirl pancakes are the best!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Such a great breakfast spot in Vancouver! You know it's good when there's a line even when it's pouring outside. As tourists, we waited in line for about 30-40minutes and it was so worth it. Banana Walnut Pancakes with the maple butter syrup was the winner for me. I've never tasted anything like it! Definitely recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food here lives up to the hype. Had the pork belly benny which had two large slabs of pork belly on it and amazing hollandaise sauce. My friend ordered the Herald street omelette which she loved and we split an order of the red velvet pancakes which are a must. Evyone around us was also raving about their food. We went on a saturday of the long weekend and think we lucked out with most people being out of town as only waited 15 minutes for a table for two

Service is excellent, none of that pretentious hipster ignore you type attitude that one can can find at many establishments in Vancouver, which I'm not a fan of. genuine friendly service and the people here seem to really enjoy working here and love the food also!

Can't wait to go back and work my way through the rest of the menu!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I finally got into Jam for brunch!  Hurray!  We were always discouraged by the very long lines on the weekend, but I have always heard such good things about the food. So fellow brunchers if you don't work, or work from home - go mid week in January and  you'll get in with only a 5-10 minute wait.  It was really nice. The food was excellent and the timing perfect. You won't wait too long or too short for your food and it was piping hot when they brought it. My daughter and I ordered two things off the menu that we wanted to both try. I had the French toast and Chicken with sweet purple cabbage. My daughter ordered Gravy Coops with the Pork Belly. This was an oversized buttermilk biscuit with two pieces of pork belly and two soft sunny side up eggs on top with mushroom gravy. Oh, oh, oh, I just about forgot we both started with a grapefruit brûlée. That is a sweet pink grapefruit half that had sugar sprinkled over it and a kitchen torch heated it up just like the sweet crunchy topping on a creamer brûléIt was pretty great overall. I'll definitely go back or try the one in Victoria BC."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best breakfasts that I've ever had.  I got the fried chicken on a (GIANT) biscuit with sausage gravy and an egg on top.  You can easily share any plate here, as the portions are huge.  The espresso cocktails and mimosas are all delicious as well.  Expect a long line, but that should not deter you.  It moves quickly - about 45 minutes wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is quite a good place for brunch, one of my favourites in Vancouver, although not every menu item is consistently amazing. I also don't think it's THAT good to warrant a 1.5 hour wait on any given day, and I find it annoying that they don't take your number and call you back - you actually have to stand in line the whole time. The good thing I will say is that their portions are HUGE. You can order half sizes of some of their menu items, which is a nice option to avoid wasting food/you feeling disgusting and bloated. I've had the pulled pork pancakes, which was delicious - very flavourful and a perfect mix of salty and sweet flavours. Most recently, I had the pork belly benedict, which was a little underwhelming, as the pork belly was a little dry. Apparently the bacon here is kind of weird (as told by my friends) - it's like sugared bacon or something, so is sweet and has a texture similar to jerky. I have been to Jam a couple of times, and would go again, although it's not a place I crave. But it is definitely a good, solid choice for brunch!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Absolutely phenomenal. Large portions. Great service. Great atmosphere. Food was fabulous.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great place for breakfast! Food is terrific and the service is good! I'd recommend sticking to the savoury dishes as the sweet ones are a little too sweet for my liking.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic breakfast. Line was long, but worth the wait as a tourist. Ordered more than I needed, but ended up not liking the oatmeal so it all worked out in the end. Potatoes are to die for!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I really enjoyed this place. Their portions are outrageously large for the price point. And their price point is really good. Definitely go for the half portion is you're not a big eater in the afternoon'ish. I ordered their pulled pork pancakes and they were absolutely delicious. Had plenty of pulled pork found throughout the pancakes.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The wait was only 20 minutes and they told us it would be 45 minutes which was a huge plus. The staff was amazing and extremely friendly. We asked for recommendations and they provided us with various options. There was an explosion of flavors with every bite. Highly recommended and must while in town.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really wanted to love this place. My husband  liked the food he ordered but mine was bland. I wouldn't have normally posted a review because was all just ok (not great or terrible), but it definitely wasn't worth the wait. The line stretches down the street, there's no waiting area inside. We got there right as it opened and it was already full and we waited almost an hour for a table. With that kind of popularity I was expecting better food, and I wouldn't have knowingly waited that long for just an ok breakfast."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is great. Great food and great service. Yes there is a wait, we had to wait in the snow but they came out and checked on us and offered umbrellas and kept us updated on the wait time. The food tasted so good and they have some of the best sausages I ever had!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of my favourite places to have brunch. The lines can get really long, but it moves quite quick. I try to get there early to make it in for the first seating once it opens. Portions are more than filling, yet quality is still there. I usually go for one of the eggs benedict and a London fog. Definitely recommend going here for a solid brunch. Service is also very friendly and welcoming."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been here a handful of times, and my review stays the same: the food is hearty and filling, and the service is fantastic.  The barista was so warm and friendly that my straight friend and I were both swooning over her as we left the bar sweating.  All the other staff have also been friendly and on top of things, and offering waffle bites to the (inevitable) lineup they have was a great touch -- definitely added that last half star for me.  Don't let the lineup discourage you though, the staff get it moving quickly enough.  

As for the food, I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered there.  The King Chicken -- ""Fried chicken breast, sugar-cured bacon, cheddar cheese, fresh tomato, lettuce and our house chipotle dressing stacked on a pretzel bun,"" paired with matchstick fries definitely left an impression.  That being said, I would recommend splitting it with a friend as it's a heavy meal.  Their specials also tend to be pretty on point (if they bring that Thanksgiving Skillet back, order it -- trust me).

All in all: staff, fantastic food, and a quaintly decorated space conveniently situated in downtown -- what's not to love?"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Amazing and creative food. The service is always amazing and the staff are super nice. Great for basic breakfast or if you're in the mood for a fancy breakfast. Eggs are always cooked to perfection
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We stumbled onto this place.  There was a line so we did take out.  The French toast and brûlée grapefruit were both very good -- even after walking it back to our hotel.  The food was simple breakfast food, but creative and delicious.  We would go back in a heartbeat."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Mixed reviews with our group here. The candied bacon was heavenly! And while everything else was decent it wasn't good enough to make me want to go back....especially to battle those lineups!
We went during a weekday morning so the lineup then was almost nonexistent which was nice. We ordered an Old Town, Charlie bowl and a Benny. The old town was a standard breakfast, as was the Benny....tasty but not to die for. The Charlie was a bit disappointing though. Totally understood it was a bowl of everything, but it tasted like leftovers...not really enticing. Also we got the little Charlie but it was still massive."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Phenomenal food that is definitely worth the wait. Their fried chicken eggs benny is to die for. Highly recommend it!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"First time checking it out in our couple day stay in vancouver. Great breakfast, worth the 15 minute line!! Pulled pork pancakes and omelette were tasty and fresh!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Awesome breaky spot! Get there early! Portions are massive and service excellent. We'll definitely be back!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came here on a Tuesday morning for brunch. I had the eggs Benedict with classic ham. it was so damn good!!!! 

I'll be raving about the medium poached egg forever."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I know this may sound ignorant as hell, but Canada just doesn't have good food. I say that from experience from eating from Vancouver to Toronto. I just don't like food from Canada...lol. With that being said, Jam Cafe is AMAZING! I'm not much of a breakfast/brunch person unless I'm on vacation and this is one of those MUST GO TO spots while in Vancouver. Yes, the line is long... Real long. I think the first time we went, we were in line for almost an hour. Second time, almost a year later, the line was about 30 minutes. If you're a local, I'm sure you know tons of other good places to eat at. However, if you're someone like me who is from Seattle and continues to get disappointed by all the food in Canada, then this is a place you have to go to so that Canadian food can redeem itself, lol. The servers are really nice and it's super clean inside. Although you're waiting in line forever, the food comes out fast and fresh!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Let me just take a moment to talk about the beauty that is the Jam Cafe. Our server was sweet and attentive, and was incredibly accommodating for one of my friends who is vegan. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict, while my friends ordered the oatmeal and French toast. My friends both adored their food, the oatmeal was apparently incredible and my friend said that it was probably one of the best things he's ever had. My fried chicken Benedict was out of this world. Generous portion of fried chicken with two perfectly poached eggs and of course topped off with delicious hollandaise and corn salsa. I would argue that it's some of the best fried chicken and one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, and I will definitely be going back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came by on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm (they close at 3pm) for three people and got seated right away. The restaurant is very nicely decorated as you walk-in and the menu/food is amazing, but I'm going to have to give this place 4 stars because I didn't appreciate the type of service I received especially from this type of restaurant. 

Food: The food here is amazing, the best brunch place I've been to in a long time, its better than Cafe Medina and just as good as Catch 122. My boyfriend and I shared the Gravy Cooper and the Cracker Jack, the biscuit that came with the Gravy Cooper is to die for. The chicken is quite tasty as well, it's not too juicy but it's crispy and well seasoned. It looks a lot like a chicken cutlet. We also ordered a side of hollandaise sauce and it was very good as well, will have to come back to try the Benny's. They have a large selection of savoury or sweet breakfast items as well as a good selection of lunch items. The entire menu looks extremely tasty. The Nutella banana French toast was quite sweet but it was very good too. The only thing I would suggest would be to maybe even share 1 breakfast item between two people because once we finished the Gravy Cooper, we were pretty much too full to even eat the Cracker Jack. The portions are huge here!! Oh and btw, you've got to try the Jam Iced Coffee!! It's so amazing, definately one of the better iced coffees I've had. 
Atmosphere: The atmosphere here is lovely, I absolutely love the hipstery knick-knacks and signages on the wall. I appreciate when restaurant have themed decor. The music was also great, not your typical Top 40s but now 70s/80s music, it matched the theme of the restaurant very well. Very cozy too, love it! 
Service: The service here was quite disappointing, our server seemed uninterested in servicing us, it could've been because we came in pretty late, but we did leave just at 3pm, so that's kind of inexcusable. She didn't smile at us once, and seemed kind of impatient when my friend was trying to decide what to have after she listed what was popular/good. The other server or expo person that ran us our food were quite cheery tho. None of them really kept an eye on clearing our plates when we were done eating though. 

Food: 5/5 
Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 2/5

The service isn't so good but they are still new so maybe it'll improve in a couple months, if you don't mind so much about service then you should definitely check this place out! The food and atmosphere here are amazing, I'll definitely be back soon, and will definitely be recommending it to others to try out. Thanks for finally opening a location in Vancouver!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great restaurant...great & creative food...very good portions...excellent value...this place is a home run in Vancouver.  There is lots of competition in our city, so for Jam Cafe' to stand out is a great reference 

Go ahead and give this place a try"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,It is one of the best of best . Food & service was awesome . Food very tasty staff friendly. This place is so popular you must wait long time to get in
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's total hangover food.... the problem is.... if you are hungover waiting in an hour line is the absolute LAST thing you would want to do. So there's that.......

It's VERY indulgent and some place I wouldn't want to go weekly.... mostly because I would be 500lbs.

Delish though! Great shredded hash which is my fave!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Naan burrito was packed with flavor.. Mushaboom burrito was nice as well. The wait and queue outside was a bit much though
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Visiting Vancouver and found this restaurant via Yelp. The reviews did mention the long wait times but didn't anticipate waiting 90 min in line while dodging pigeons flying overhead.  But at the end the food and service turned out to be good off setting the waiting experience. Decent vegetarian choices. My family tried the cracker jack, huevos rancheros(veggie) and mushaboon. The corn bread was amazing and so was the brioche toast in the cracker jack. A very satisfying experience!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited for 45-ish minutes on a Sunday morning, having gotten to the line about 9:30.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely!  We're from Seattle, so this isn't something we'll be doing every weekend, but it was an excellent recommendation from our hotel.  Everything sounded (and looked) incredible, so we ended up splitting 3 entrees: regular eggs Benny half order with avocado; full Fried chicken Benny; and the Nutella and banana stuffed French toast.  Add in a couple of fancy mimosas (blood orange for me), and some hot coffee, and it was brunch nirvana!  Small interior, but we didn't feel cramped. Our server was wonderful, and the atmosphere and design of the restaurant was great. Everyone around us was constantly gushing as their food arrived, and talking about how the wait was worth it as they left.  Some delay in getting our meal, but it didn't bother us as we had drinks."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came at 920 in the morning on a Sunday and it was already packed so come early. Got the gravy coop. Best brunch I've had in a while. Chicken tender and juicy, biscuits crisp af, hash brown fresh. Huge portions so come with a huge appetite!! Would come again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place was beyond my expectations. Service was perfect, food was ridiculous and the owner was super friendly. Love going to a place where everyone is checking out what the other table had ordered because it's so yummy, crazy good and let's just say HUGE!!! Highly recommend going here!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Charlie bowl is definitely a must order - though I recommend the small Charlie bowl for people with small-med appetites.

No 2 hours line ups like Medinas! Great value and food!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It was our first time here and won't be our last! The room has a lot of personality and the staff is prompt and attentive. We got classic Caesars to start and man were they delicious!
We both got the traditional eggs benidict and the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise was rich and creamy and the hash browns were of the shredded and pan fried variety and were seasoned well and so tasty! 
Saw so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to come back and try!
If you want breakfast/brunch done properly, I highly recommend Jam!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Excellent breakfast and worth the wait. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff and good value. Will certainly be coming back again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I think this place is good but overhyped. We waited an hour to get in and another 20 min for our food which is quite frankly ridiculous. We ordered the fried chicken and french toast (chicken was good, French toast was blah), and the Gravy Coop (fried chicken, over easy egg, hash browns, gravy, biscuit, etc) which was good. It's a cute place and the food is good but I'd only recommend it if you don't have to wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Sometimes what you need is a big breakfast at 1PM on a Tuesday. Jam Cafe has got you covered. The portions are generous, everything was perfectly cooked, and the fruit salad was sufficiently exotic. No sad wedges of honeydew here, it's all gooseberries and kiwi and pineapple.

I used to hit up the aggressively mediocre Ricky's across the road when I was looking for a big greasy fry-up on the quick, but Jam Cafe eclipses them in every breakfast category."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The best breakfast I have EVER had!!!! While visiting from California we decided to try this place out based on the review and we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. I had the best eggs Benedict I have ever had. I have yet to find somewhere at home with anything that comes close :(. Also, the red velvet pancakes are the best!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My friends & I were visiting Canada & this place definitely did not disappoint. Once we arrived, there was already a line to get seated. The line didn't feel as long as it looked. I ordered the gravy coop & it was poppin!! Their sweet potato fries were really good too. What really sold me was that this place was able to give my friends & I separate checks AND split the cost of the items we shared. I'm not sure if that's a norm in Canada, but restaurants definitely don't do that in the Bay Area. I'd go back to Canada just to eat here :-)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The best breakfast place in town. I don't need to write more than that. Now do yourself a favor and try it for yourself. You will not be dissatisfied with the decision to dine at this place. Plus, the line is a good indicator that the restaurant serves great breakfast."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,One of my favourite brunch places in Vancouver. Food absolutely delicious and worth the wait!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We went for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and were sat right away. 
The decor is super hipstery, but I get what they were trying to do. (the typewriter in the bathroom is a little much, lol).

I got the Little Veggie Bowl and it was more than enough food! Seriously, don't get the normal size. I don't even know how a normal human can eat that much. Or split it with someone.

The food was great, the server was nice.

Go get your jam on ;)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Googled 'best breakfast near me' and this was what came up! A fairly small place with good sized line ups outside. Always a bit of a gamble when you wait in line for a good chunk of time-fingers crosses that it was worth the wait. Good news-it was! The husband had the pancakes (triple stack) with lemon and blueberry and I had the waffle board with apples and cinnamon. Absolutely lovely food! Did NOT need to eat again until dinner that evening. Generous portions (definitely shareable) and the coffee was delicious. The service was friendly and efficient and the overall ambience in the restaurant was lovely. Would definitely eat here again!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Like many of the other posts there was a queue even on a Monday mid morning. Had the breakfast biscuit which was yummy and felt bad for leaving some of it but the portions are huge. Proper tea brewed in a pot and then in a decent sized mug - long queue but worth the wait. Didn't eat for the rest of the day!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I can't tell you just how amazing all the food is here. 
Wonderful service. Wonderful decor.

Worth all the wait.

Their house made jalapeño hotsauce is awesome. They will be selling it by the bottle soon!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great place with great vibe. Perfect for brunch. And the price is incredible for the portion. One thing tho, it's so crowded we had to queue for 1.5 hours!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food was 5/5
The staff friendliness and service was 5/5 
The atmos was 4.5/5 

The wait can be very long, especially on weekends as this a great and trendy breakfast brunch place.

Breakfast all day! Yes. 

I had the Harrison fernando (fittingly) and it was wicked good. Highly recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Please didn't live up to the hype. Food came cold. Sent back. Came back alright but not the best. Had the fried chicken Benny, flavours were lacking.  Waited in line for this, so extremely disappointed."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great pancakes with blueberries and CHARLIE bowl.  Couldn't even finish one portion.  So damn good.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing breakfast and totally worth the wait! However, even if you are starving you will not be able to eat even half of the Charlie bowl- it's huge so you'll have leftovers. The sugar candied bacon is also top notch. I can't say enough good things about this place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The restaurant did not disappoint. I went here for breakfast after reading so many good reviews. Breakfast was excellent with large portions. Two people can easily split a dish.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Had the chicken French toast and my fiancé ordered the green eggs and ham. We both loved the food and managed to finish everything (which is a big deal considering how generous the portions are)! The place is clean and the decor is unique (I think the owner said his wife made most of it, which I think is amazing). Only negative thing to say is that there is almost always a line, but that's the price to pay for good food at a popular place. The staff go outside regularly to take names down and give estimated times, and the lines don't take that long anyhow, so give it a go if you don't mind a short wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Always an awesome time in Jam. Severs and hosts are always very friendly. Been here multiple times and the food is always great. Just be aware of line-ups. Usually a good 15-20min wait each time depending on the time of day.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Awesome breakfast place! Beautiful decor, great service, and fantastic food. Really enjoyed the experience."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Slightly overrated. There is always a ginormous line up no matter the time and day and I'm not sure why. The candied bacon is fantastic but that's about it. Everything is kind of overpriced. I wouldn't order anything without the candied bacon, and if you do, always order a side of candied bacon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Good food but why do you have to pay 75cents for hot water.  Wow! Ridiculous! Seeing they are always busy. GREEDY.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Jam cafe is always a hit!! The only downfall is the wait to get in. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed with any of the dishes I have gotten. Everything on the menu sounds delicious so I find it hard to decide on what I want. Overall you must try this place and go early!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,the long wait is worth it! the little charlie bowl and the bruleed grapefruit made my world go round. i wouldn't get the london fog again; it was too sweet but other than that i was so pleased with this place! the portions are such that you have plenty more to munch on later. the service was SO SO SO nice! even while we were waiting in line someone came out and gave us all some little waffle bites to hold us over. we'd for sure go back again!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I really enjoyed my breakfast which was a half order of eggs Benedict with bacon and a pancake . I enjoyed the potato rosti and the Benedict but I felt the pancake was too thick and too big. It became overwhelming and wasn't tasty. Not light and fluffy as you would expect a pancake to be. My cousin had the Charlie bowl and she said it was way too large and didn't enjoy the flavours. She didn't like the gravy and mushiness.  Overall, this was my second time at Jam in Vancouver and I enjoyed it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Stopped over at the Victoria location a year ago while visiting a friend and so we decided to give it a try at home. As with the Victoria location, it definitely didn't disappoint!!

They have a unique menu with lots of unregrettable options. The prices are descent, but while we were visiting on a weekday and it was busy, I can't imagine how wild this gets during weekends."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There was a 15 minute wait to get inside and now I understand why. Our friendly waiter reccomended we try one of their house specialities, the eggs Benny with chicken. We combined this with French toast and fruits which made an ideal balance of sweet and savoury for two people. We gaped some of the huge portions that were being brought out especially the pancakes. For our eggs Benedict, the eggs were soft and added fresh creamy taste to the chicken, which had a light chewy texture under a lush mound of hollandaise. This was brought the same time as our toast. Wonderfully thick slices of French toast and a lovely coating of sweet but not overpowering strawberries and bananas. Plenty of sauce left on the plate to ensure your bread is never dry! Will definitely be returning to try other items on the menu!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went with my friend and had such a good time! It was a little bit of a wait, there was a lineup going out the door, but we were seated in a pretty good time given it was just the two of us, less than 10 minutes, I'd say.

It was fairly busy, the restaurant was packed and the servers were all busy with their tables, but we got water and our menus in a good time. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict and my friend got the Red Velvet Pancake. We decided to divide our orders so we could taste each other's. 

The eggs benedict tasted so good! I almost wish I didn't divide it up with my friend, since the salmon tasted just right and the capers made the whole thing come together. My friend's pancake (we ordered just the one), was actually quite big. Like the name suggests, it was like a red velvet pancake, and it had a cream cheese drizzle over it--I personally found it sweeter than what I'd normally like for breakfast, but my friend has a sweet tooth and enjoyed it immensely. 

I'd love to come back, hopefully on a weekday when it's not as busy!! :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Two words.  Charlie Bowl.

This place is soon yummy.  The only only complaint I have is the long wait, but still not a big enough reason to deduct a star. Open more please!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Believe the reviews and the Lonely Planet recommendation on this place. It's pretty amazing from the service to the food to the ambiance of the place. We got there around 8:45 on a Sunday, waited for about 45 minutes, but well worth it. The staff are welcoming, friendly, attentive, and well coordinated. Something I haven't seen in a long time. The price is worth the quantity and quality of food. I'd come back here in a heart beat and would recommend it to anyone visiting."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Decided to come here for lunch on a weekday, party of 2. My oh my, how is it possible there was a huge lineup outside in the rain, on a WEEKDAY? I thought to myself ""this place better be good!"". After parking in the paid lot across the street, we waited outside with an umbrella for about 30 mins and was greeted by a nice gal. We sat at the first avail seating - which was at the bar. It was very roomy, not squished and felt comfy. 

I ordered ""The Gravy Coupe"" and it was delicious. I only wished there was a little bit more gravy and a little less biscuit. The fried chicken was moist and well seasoned. The hash brown was alright, a little bit on the dry side, but it could be the style. I will definitely come back and try the other goodies, my next try will be the ""green eggs and ham""!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Crazy waits after 11am! We intended to beat the rush, arrived at 10:30am, and was quickly seated. We were seated right by the window, and we saw how crazy the line ups were once it hit 11am.

We got the chicken n' waffles, chicken french toast, and french toast brioche (with strawberries and bananas). The chicken n' waffles were alright. I have to say, I enjoyed the crispy chicken & waffles from Tuc Craft Kitchen more. The gravy at Jam Cafe was a little bland, and I thought that most of the flavour had to come from the maple syrup (which was super authentic and really tasteful, by the way) that I added on. The chicken and french toast was a winner for me. The tobasco honey jalapeño sour cream was unique and something I never would thought of combining together. It is not spicy at all, and goes very well with the soft french toast and the crispy chicken. The french toast brioche was good, but nothing really stood out. My friend complained that the bananas were too soggy and pushed them all aside. I, on the other hand, thought that the bananas were just right, and ate all the ones that she didn't want. 

Good thing about the coffee was that they offer free refills, and my friend managed to drink 3 cups of coffee as they just kept on pouring more into her cup! It was a good experience overall, and I hope to visit their location in Victoria to see how it compares!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The wait time was worth it. Very rustic and delicious breakfast fast service and friendly. We had the eggs Benedict with chorizo, with the farmers skillet  and both were delicious. Good size portions and very good juice try it if you don't mind the wait remember ppl won't wait for bad food"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,My brother and I stopped by on our way to whistler! Loved this little place - food was great and staff was friendly!! Will definitely be back
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Just realized I hadn't reviewed the Jam Café on Beatty. It was such a nice surprise to find it in Vancouver after experiencing the Jam in Victoria last year. The breakfasts are really top quality, large and delicious. They really know what they are doing, and the line to get in was fifty feet down the sidewalk. It took a good half hour to get a seat, but boy was it worth it. Of course the service and décor were both great as well. People here are having a good time and enjoying their meal and the company they are with."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food at Jam Cafe is so good but be prepared to wait in the lineup. It opens at 8am so if you are an early riser it's not the best.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Reviewers who have commented about the wait are right.  It was 40 minutes on a Saturday morning at 9:00AM.  The place is relatively small, but it was worth the wait.  There were 4 of us - 2 ordered pancakes and 2 ordered waffles, all with blueberries.  I've never seen fresher, real blueberries on top of pancakes/waffles.  The wait staff was very friendly and nice and the service was quick, but not rushed."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best brunch I have ever had! The pancakes with cinnamon cream cheese swirl were incredibly delicious. I can't wait to go back for more!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"By far the best breakfast I've had in Vancouver to date! There was a short line when I showed up so had to wait maybe 10 min...but they offered everyone in line complimentary coffee while we waited...what a GREAT touch!!!

I had the Gravy Coop, basically biscuits and gravy with fried chicken, which looked as amazing as it tasted! And the staff was great, super friendly and personable! I am definitely going back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, especially as this is an IG foodie-favourite in Vancouver. My friend and I got the ""Little Charlie"" and the French Brioche, that comes with fried chicken. The portions are not for the faint of heart aka they are huge portions. The Little Charlie was my fave amongst the two: filling and satisfyingly good. 

Service was great and the place has a cool decor and vibe inside. Definitely want to go back and stuff myself with the red velvet pancakes next time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We recently vacationed in Vancouver. A foodie friend of mine is from there and gave me a list of restaurants to visit. She warned us that the lines at JAM are very long if you don't get there early. We should have heeded her warning. Despite the temptation to leave the line, we waited it out and boy was it worth it. My daughter and I agreed it was the best breakfast out we've ever had. I had french toast with caramelized apples - a party in my mouth - absolutely delicious. My daughter had the huevos. I'm a big fan of huevos and have tried them in countless restaurants - these were by far the best I've ever had. My husband is pretty happy with any basic breakfast and even he admitted his meal was really great. I would absolutely come back... other than the line, it really can't get much better!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Good food! Awesome nice staff! I ordered the farmer's skillet and forgot to ask for light cheese. I ended up putting aside most of the cheese. A gentleman came by after (assumed he was owner) and asked if my meal was okay and if there was too much cheese. I appreciated his attentiveness! Their jalapeño salsa/sauce is a must try!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Best breakfast I had in a while! Absolutely worth the wait! Didn't ménage to take photos of our food because we all ate it to fast. Absolutely recommend this place for breakfast/brunch if you're in Vancouver.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good breakky but who wants to stand in line for hours waiting to eat?  
Not this girl. If you get in line early, it's worth it but otherwise hit up Rickie's across the street.  The Jam Cafe has a unique menu and the atmosphere is really nice."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Well priced, with basic breakfast options. Would I wait for 30 minutes or more for this? Definitely not. The food was good but I don't understand the hype.   
It was basic flavours with not much creativity- easily made at home. 

Fast and friendly service though! I think the reason people love Jam is because it's inexpensive and Vancouver has a limited food scene."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious food. A recommendation for out of towners and brunch enthusiasts!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great Pork Belly, great Salsa Verde, 45 min line, benedicts a bit overcooked.  Score 9!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Delicious brunch. Large portions. Make sure to come hungry. Came on a Monday at 11am and the wait was 40 min. The restaurant is small, so a party of 2 is your best shot at securing a table. I had the chicken French toast-- 2 thick slices of brioche French toast topped with a juicy, crispy fried chicken breast, pickled cabbage, and a savory honey sauce. It was a delightful combination of flavors, very filling, and a great alternative to eating the typically sweet, sugary brunch dish. Surprisingly, the sauce did not make the bread soggy-- Bonus points! My fiance had the pork belly benedict. The pork belly wasn't too fatty and skin was nice and crispy. It came with hash browns and some fruit. He really loved the green hot sauce available on the table. Staff was friendly and very attentive to coffee refills. You get cute little lollipops with the check. Would come again, but probably avoid the weekends if there's already a 40 min wait on Monday."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"No line up? Yea right! This place is always packed and for good reason. It's small and turns it's tables pretty quickly, so if you have patience wait in the line! I had the chicken and biscuits with gravy and my friend had the chicken and waffles. Both of us finished our plates and then rolled home."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam is a fairly small place, so get there early if you can. Otherwise, expect to wait in line on the street, as there is sure to be an extended wait. Trust me, it is worth it. We went for breakfast while visiting Vancouver, and my husband has pledged that we will return to this restaurant on our next trip. Bloody Caesars were sublime, and the candied bacon garnish was a surprising treat. I had chicken and French toast, which had a savory BBQ sauce that was almost Asian in flavor. I can't really describe it other to say that it was heavenly. My husband had Nutella & banana French toast, and he couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was. Hearty servings, flavorful food, and excellent service--what more could you want?"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Nice little place decor was fun. It's busy but they are quick and efficient. The food looked really good but Unfortunately I did not like my French toast Nutella banana and fruit concoction it was extremely dry and the bread was just too much. The gravy coop was decent but there wasn't anything special about either meals. I'm glad we checked it out but I personally found it a bit boring maybe what we ordered just wasn't the best pick.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"not a HEALTH CODE VIOLATION but refilling ketchup, hot sauce and BBQ sauce from old bottles is GROSS 

if you have to do it then please do it in the kitchen

the wait was long - friday at 12:45, waited for 15 minutes
the food was good
the presentation amazing
the portions are double sized

but DONT TOUCH THE CONDIMENTS"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long line ups and big portions! I'm not a fan of lineups, but this was worth it. Go hungry, leave happy. The pancakes are bigger than your face!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Lovely staff that accomodated our 7 person group during their busy lunch. It was fantastic food! Line up early since they do get busy around noon.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Greatest brunch place, I wish they were located in Seattle! I would drive the fours hours just to have brunch here again. The pan fried oatmeal blows all misconceptions you may have had of oatmeal."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing breakfast spot.  Food and atmosphere are the best. I went with biscuits and gravy with a pancake on the side, and my wife had an omelette... yum is all I can say!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We waited in line for 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait. Food was amazing. Brunch cocktails were frothy and delightful. Great service. Pleasant atmosphere. Visiting from the states and had a great experience. Would Jam again.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The chicken and waffles were more than filling. Large portions, great especially for a Sunday hangover, but plan ahead and if your going back to the office after lunch. It's very busy as it is well know for it's brunch. Ate with 3 others and everyone was happy with their dishes and everything looked good."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Awesome breakfast spot with huge portions.  The signature coffee was a bit sweet for me but everything was delicious. Small dining area, so be sure to get there early."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One thing I really can't get past with this place is their system (or complete lack thereof) for lining up. When you arrive here to eat, they full on expect you to just stand in line, most of which is not under an awning and annoys the people you are blocking to get into the neighbouring residences and offices. You don't give your name to anyone or party size (until you are close to the front, which really makes it hard for them to prioritize and optimize seating based on party size). In 2019, there's so many better ways to do this - there are services to text a number when your table is ready, they could also take people's names down and ask them to return at a later time (like Medina does). There's something about just standing there that makes an hour + feel A LOT longer than if you could walk away, grab a coffee, browse in nearby shops, etc. I think the owners must think that people seeing a line outside will attract more people to their business, but their name and reputation are well known. I don't feel I'll likely return to this establishment until this changes. There are other good breakfast spots in this city that don't have this weird lineup system."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Food is very tasty! Service is very good from the hostess trying to manage the long line out the door to the rest of servers and others bussing and helping. The portions are pretty big depending what you get. We had the chicken and waffles - it had nice flavors but you could still taste the food and it's not too rich. The gravy was fairly light. They also have homemade jalapeño sauce that was quite good too. It's worth the wait - we waited about 30 min.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Amazing food...if you can stick out the hour-and-a-half wait time. Pulled pork pancakes are awesome!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I have been looking forward to going to the new brunch location. Jam didn't disappoint in the least. Owner met us at the door. Our serve was friendly and knowledgable. A wide selection and variety of dishes. The plates were huge. overall I was not disappointed and had a great time. I left in a food coma and still craving more.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Super busy and a tad chilly but the food and mimosas are worth the wait.

I had the French toast and if I wasn't stuffed I could've gone for seconds"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food was absolutely amazing. We waited 40 minutes to be seated but it was worthwhile. The fried chicken eggs benedict and brioche french toast was fantastic. They did not rush to make our food or rush us to leave even though there were still lines outside.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Soooo goooood! Every time I eat here I leave stuffed as I have no self control when it comes to great breakfast food. I have only had great experiences with service, the decor is fun and the vibe is casual and inviting. It's not a huge space and it does get pretty busy, so it's probably not the best place to bring a big group."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Five days later and back home in the States and I'm still thinking about this breakfast!  Of course there was a line, but it went quite quickly.  And it was worth it!!  Portions are huge.  I had the ""small"" veggie bowl and barely made a dent.  Tempted to eat meat (after over 20 years without) so that I could have the pulled pork and waffle or chicken and waffle.  Service was quick and friendly.  Will definitely be back if ever in Vancouver again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Dreams came true today at the Jam Cafe. Banana Nutella French toast, chicken and waffles, grapefruit brûlée, and THE BEST BACON I HAVE EVER HAD. My friend and I were seated at the bar and we had some of the most friendly service. Loved watching the wide variety of drinks being made while chatting. If I ever find myself in Vancouver again, you better believe I will be coming here. Please expand to Austin!!!- the foodies here will love it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We're from Portland where restaurant expectations are high and breakfast places are in constant abundance. This place was fantastic and I am so happy that we waited in line for it while on vacation in this city. The drinks were also incredible and I wish I had ordered another one. Haha It's definitely a good sign if we were both arguing with ourselves about what to order because there were too many tasty options to choose from! Don't let the line scare you, it moves faster than you would think!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Awesome food but do not think it is worth the hype or line up. Go early before it even opens so you dont have to wait too long
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"True No. 1 breakfast choice in Vancouver! Fusion breakfast, not average Joe type egg/bacon/pancake.  Recommend!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great breakfast! The cinnamon swirl pancakes were amazing! The portions were huge. Well worth the 20 minute wait.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went here for breakfast this morning while on vacation.  It was amazing.   I would move here just for breakfast. I had the Little Charlie, which was still huge,  and a grapefruit mimosa.   We're planning on going back tomorrow.  And don't be afraid of the line,  it moves quickly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,After all this great recommendations we went for breakfast to jam and it was great. But you really have to wait a little bit before you are going to be seated. We ate different breakfasts and shared it and I have to say you really get a big serving and the food is very fresh an delicious there.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Visiting from San Diego, the cinnamon roll pancake was by far our favorite part of our trip!!!! It's a must!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Delicious breakfast. Lovely decor. Great Service. I highly recommend the Charlie Bowl.  The biscuit was so soft yet had an outer crumbly crunchy texture. The ham was so good! A+!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Used yelp to find this place & the food was gr8. Went here on wed am after 9 had to wait about 30 mins. I got the jam cafe coffee (which is an iced coffee) and then got the chicken with French toast. The fried chicken here was gr8.would definitely recommend this place
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I was in training for a bodybuilding show, and in my final 2 weeks was thinking what will be my treat meal after this is over. I aded a friend who is a highly acclaimed chef in Vancouver where to go for the best breakfast in Vancouver. He said Jam Cafe. When you are in your final peak week of prepping for a competition, that reward mealis what keeps you going. I show ul bright and early Sunday morning and there is a line well out the door. Clearly this is the right place. I had the Eggs Bendedict and they were amazing, especially with the home-made Jalapenio sauce. Portions are generous... but i was still hungry and had cravings so on to the banana strawberry pancakes... 

Definitely lived up to expectations. It was delicious. People nextvto me were talkng about how good their food was and taking pictures of it. Staff and service was great too. My go to breakfast place now, hands down (when i am allowed to eat :) )"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Found this cafe on yelp based on the reviews. And they did not lie! There was street parking available but if you can't find anything there is a parking structure right across from it. There was a line outside of the cafe, but since I only needed seating for 2 people so they sat us in right away(due to availability). Our host was welcoming and friendly! All the staff were!!! It didn't take long for our food to come out, and even if it did the food is WORTH the wait. The portions they served were the right amount. I was full 3/4 of way into my skillet but I could not let the food go to waste. Cost for breakfast was reasonable. If I'm ever in town again I will definitely be going back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Huge portions, great service, and incredible food! A place you keep coming back to as it is what a brunch place should be!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Food and service was amazing! Could have a system of taking cell numbers for a waiting list and having a coffee station instead of an hour+ wait in line outside. Food and service was incredible though!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yummy!!! We are visiting vegetarians to Vancouver and read good reviews so thought to try it. Turned back the first day for the long line but braved the 20 min wait on day 2. We were not sure how egg dishes could be so good - as per reviews - but they were. 

Portions are huge so consider sharing or getting half sizes. We got the half veggie benedict which was so good. Perfectly flavored with the poached egg, spinach and Goat cheese. And the mini veggie bowl wHich was a cornucopia of warm tastes and texture and just so good!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We went on a Friday morning and waited about 30-40 min. Got the Charlie bowl and the pancakes with bananas and Nutella. The Caesar was delicious. The bacon in it was even better. Delicious meal and was worth the wait. All of the staff was really friendly, too."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the farmers skillet with a side of French toast. Eggs Benedict was great minus the fact that it came out cold :(. Skillet was a definite hit! So tasty and hearty. Unfortunately we definitely don't recommend the French toast as it was really hard and seemed to be lacking in flavor. Overall would love to try more menu items!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Loved this place! Great food, great atmosphere, great service! We went twice in 2 days. The first day we went all out and ordered the three little pigs, chicken and waffles, and the mac and cheese sandwich. The mac and cheese sandwich was amazing! The tomato jam wasn't my favorite on the sandwich personally though. The second day I had the B.E.L.C.H. Sandwich and my husband had the three little pigs again. Their maple butter to dip the three little pigs in was addicting! Really enjoyed their fruit salad, coffee, and mimosas! Can't wait to come back to Vancouver to visit the Jam Cafe again! :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had the ""Hangover"" bowl, which was actually pretty good. Had I actually had a hangover, I bet it would've been 10x better. The service was fast and everyone was extremely friendly!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Had breakfast at Jam Cafe while in Vancouver, visiting from California. It's an awesome breakfast spot! We did have to wait in a short line outside for ~20 minutes (and it was a Tuesday). We ended up getting 'bar' seating, where one person handled the bar, coffee drinks and the guests at the bar- and she managed it all with a smile on her face! Great food, great service, and one of our dishes was garnished with Gooseberry, which I've never had (it was delicious!!)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"AWESOME!  i ordered egg benedict with smoked salmon its super delicious! but i would give advise here, its kinda not enougn for this set, would be so much better if they could add 2 more toast to go with! and the total was around $20 ( egg benedict with smoked salmon + Americano)
and usually in the weekend its many people and it takes you around 30 mintues to line up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jams was the jam. Everything about this place made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. This place has huge portions so you're not going to leave hungry. I loved it so much I went twice in my 4 day visit. The chicken and waffles is out of this world, and I live in Georgia so that's saying something. I had the same server, Adam, both days I went in and he remembered me and asked how my time in Vancouver. He was a top notch mate that knew his stuff. I also had a great conversation with the owner of jams, Mike, he was kind and humble. I highly recommend this joint. Just get in there. You won't regret it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place was stupid good. Went for brunch on a Thursday so we didn't have a wait, but when we left there was a sizable line, so plan ahead. Service was friendly and quick. Coffee was great, we ordered a lone piggy to split (sausage covered in pancake batter fried) and I wish I would have ordered like 10 of those. I got the brioche French toast and bf got the Charlie bowl. Server suggested the small and glad we took her advice. It was huge! Dum dum lollipops came with the check. Can't wait to go back when I'm back in July. Highly recommend!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place was delicious! The coffee cocktails we ordered were delicious. I think the pancakes are a bit over-hyped, but still pretty good. We ordered the cream cheese cinnamon swirl pancakes, a side of the cranberry toast, and the black stone Benedict, plus two coffee cocktails for me and 3 for my boyfriend. Cocktails were by far the best part."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"BEST. SALMON. BENNY. EVER. 
Only con: Must wait suuuuuuuuper long (as in, more than 20 minutes on a weekday 10am)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Not sure how I've missed this gem! Great atmosphere, the Benny's are awesome and the rest of the menu looks really tasty, great coffee and laid back but attentive service."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited in line about 45 minutes in the rain, finally got in, sat at the bar so worth it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A must try. I always get a half order of Benny and then one pancake depending on what I'm craving...and yes you can order just one pancake, you don't need to order the entire stack. No one ever finishes it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The ONLY downside is the wait- but it is 100% worth it. We had the brioche French toast and large Charlie bowl- massive portions and absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious. This place really has exceptional breakfast food- kept us full and happy for a long time :)
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been here several times now, and brought friends. Come when they open! I've twice watched them go from 0 to full in less than thirty minutes. They open at 8AM, and, it's easy to enjoy a nice meal and be out by 9AM. The menu is pricy, but has giant portions and food quality you just can't beat for breakfast. My fave? The farmer's skillet!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I am a firm believer In writing good reviews when a restaurant is worthy of one! Jam without a doubt served one of the best breakfast we have ever had! Everything was fresh and delicious, the eggs were amazing, I never usually comment on eggs seems kind of weird to do so but the eggs Benedict/vegetarian style were out of this world. Coffee was strong and good. Great atmosphere, very accommodating staff from the hostess to the server. Adam was our server, professional, knowledgeable and by all means an asset to this restaurant ! On every level this place is a gem! So when you asked to be seated and you're told 20 minutes to a half hour wait just say great and wait... because you're in for culinary extravaganza!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great food! And cool environment. 

The veggie bowl is big enough to feed three hungry adults. The green eggs and ham were good, and also large enough to share between two semi hungry adults. 

The line is crazy long....be prepared to wait, especially if you have a bigger party. 

Overheard local patrons and waitress complaining about it be overrun with tourists...so there's that"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went here with my friend on Monday. The lineup was super long but we only waited about 20 minutes because there was only 2 of us, so we got in faster.
I ordered the Little Charlie. It has shredded hashbrowns in it which is one of my guilty pleasures.. Honestly it was good but not amazing. Even though I ordered the Little Charlie, the bowl was still huge and I had to take half of it home! I probably would not come back here just because it was so hyped up and it isn't SO good to where it would make me crave it. Kind of wish I tried the red velvet pancakes though, I heard those were really good."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Wow!  Loved everything about the city of Vancouver, but having brunch at this spot was surely one of the highlights.  It's very popular with the locals and you should be prepared to wait in line to get in, but it's more than worth it.  If I lived here, I would no doubt be a regular.  Great vibe, ridiculously good food, quality service.  This will probably sound like hyperbole, but it was maybe one of the best brunch experiences of my life.  The cinnamon pancakes are for real and the Charlie Bowl is something to behold.. and be eaten.  If you're in town and hungry, just go.  You won't regret it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The cocktails were actually my favorite. I had a caesar with a huge slice of bacon and pickle juice. I want to go back for just this drink. The food was actually about par for breakfast spots, nothing special but 100% delicious."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,We arrived at 7:45am and it was totally worth it. We got in on the first seating and both really enjoyed our meals.  Smooth coffee and fresh juice to start.  Our meals were well plated--almost too much food.  My fav part was the cranberry toast. I recommend highly.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breakfast in the city!  Worth the line up but go early so it's no too long.  Fried Chicken Eggs Benny is amazing and so are the little piggies, don't share though!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The red velvet pancakes are heavenly!! The wait time is a bit of a deterrent though, and I'm not sure the quality of food justifies the wait"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I got the Gravy Coupe which is a play on biscuits and gravy. It was delicious and I couldn't even finish the huge biscuit they gave us. Definitely worth $15 for brunch. My friends got the Charlie Bowl which is a massive bowl of a bit of everything they served. They barely made a dent and had to take the rest home. Great customer service and great food, I will be back for more."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great breakfast, pork belly benny is my go to! Blood orange mimosa!this place is great, the line sucks but if you can catch it on a day without the line it's worth your time!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"OMG. This place is absolutely phenomenal.

I went here with a bunch of people at least three times on my trip to Vancouver.  Oh, and we are very, very ""spoiled"" with amazing food from where we come from.  This all being said, Jam Cafe is absolutely phenomenal.

My ONLY complaint (hey, it's not a perfect world), in retrospect, reflects more upon the entire Vancouver culture rather than Jam Cafe:  they nickel-and-dime you to death.  Again, in retrospect after our 9 day trip to Vancouver, I realize it's not just Jam Cafe that will charge you $.50, or $1.00 for a tiny little side of sauce (and when they serve it they don't tell you they charge extra).  BUT, not to say that Jam Cafe can't be a light in the dark and NOT nickel-and-dime people like other places in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It's a long wait but the food is amazing.  Everything looked great, and the pulled pork pancakes were amazing.  Well done!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing breakfast foods! There is usually quite the line up so make sure to get there early! The food here is amazing and the price is often worth the quality of food. I adore their apple bratwurst and the sugar cured bacon with any dish I order! The portions are also quite big and more often than not, I find myself stuffed and satisfied!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam Cafe is a main stay in my brunch cycle. It is always worth the wait. The mushaboom burger is delicious, their cinnamon swirl pancake is delicious, their veggie eggs Benedict is believe it or not soooo delicious. Such a great depth of flavour with all the veggies. If I could avoid the lines I'd come more frequently but whenever my family is in town we all go and thoroughly enjoy ourselves. Really great service too! Love it. A great restaurant all around."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"2 words: worth the hype. We got there right at opening on a Friday opening and it didn't fill up till about half an hour later. Honestly their menu selection was so incredible we spent more time deciding what to eat than actually eating it. In the end we got the gravy coupe and the fried chicken eggs benedict. I really loved their fried chicken, the portions were so generous and you ended up having more chicken left than anything else. The hollandaise could have been more flavourful but both the biscuit in the coupe and the English muffin for the benny were so soft and flaky. The plate was also so busy that you can make different combinations, like gravy with biscuit or hashbrowns and hollandaise etc.
A restaurant really stands out for me if it has little surprises other than the main meal. In this case they have a delicious home made hot sauce made of jalapeños. It was so good, my friend and I used half the bottle for our hashbrowns and rest of breakfast. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is also a gem. Finally our server Kim was very sweet and a pleasure throughout our meal. 
Definitely will come back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Deep fried dishes are usually pretty oily, perhaps they aren't frying properly.. still tasty though! Also, arrive early as there is almost always a wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Thoroughly impressed with this little gem! I live in the area and walk by any day between the hours of 9:30-2, there is a line up of 4-20 people. Of course this is at least a minor indication it's worth trying, so I stopped by at 9:15 hoping to beat the rush and was in within 5 minutes. The service is great, friendly and knowledgable staff (Mel at the bar in particular!) warm environment and most of all, the food is 10/10. I ordered the bacon eggs Benedict with avocado, all the ingredients were fresh and high quality, from the thick candied bacon to the perfectly ripe avocado, I enjoyed it very much. Definitely worth a visit, even worth the wait in the, at times, long line up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of my favorite brunch places in Vancouver, defintiely worth visiting. The nutella/banana frenchtoast is to die for."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I liked the fact that the menu has so many dishes for you to choose from, I will be back for sure to try other dishes. My friend ordered the Gravy Coop, and I ordered the Charlie Bowl (smaller size). It tasted amazing at first, like the ultimate comfort brunch food, but after a while everything just tasted of the gravy and potato hash, which in my opinion, there was too much of. Serverice was friendly, our food took a while, but it was understandable since it was busy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Totally worth the wait. The cinnamon swirl pancakes are to die for and can never really go wrong with any other item on the menu. Best brunch sport in Vancouver by miles.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Huge portions.... That's about it. I don't know how anyone could compare the level of food here compared to say chambar or medinas....we ordered the fried chicken, extremely dry, and it came with waffles that were also massive but again, not fluffy and crispy on the outside like an ideal waffle. Overall disappointing given the Victoria one tasted way better when we went."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"i got smoked salmon eggs benedict and my aunt got the ""green eggs and ham"" which is pesto goat cheese ham all in eggs on a piece of toast or a biscuit. AMAZING food. worth the (quick) 25 minute wait to get a seat! went on a thursday at around 11 am"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best way to describe everything about Jam: WOW. We waited for a table for 45 minutes which honestly isn't bad for Vancouver. For all the brunch we ate while here, Jam is a hands down standout. Get in line, get in the door, and get ready for some real comfort food."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazingly delicious and reasonably priced for a lot of food. Service was fabulous too. Worth the waiting in line for a table, even in the rain!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We came into this restaurant with high hopes, all the reviews were great.  The Jam Cafe was anything but; the wait was long and the food was bad.  We ordered 3 different plates and I will review each individually:

Red Velvet Pancakes: 1/5 - The pancakes tasted nothing like red velvet and were very dissatisfying.  The ""cream cheese icing"" tasted nothing of the sort; it was sour and very unpleasant.

Egg/Meat Skillet: 2/5 - The skillet wasn't very good, but was served as advertised.

Chicken and Waffles: 2/5 - The waffles were tasty but the gravy topping was not.  Without the gravy, the meal would have been much better; the texture and taste did not compliment the waffles or chicken.

I hope this review helps some out.  If there is no wait, I would recommend you try it for yourself.  But, the hour long wait combined with the poor food made our experience at Jam Cafe an unpleasant one."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place gets very busy even on the weekdays! Their decor is very cool with all their old, antique artifacts. I only tried their basic breakfast meal and their salmon eggs benedict. Their simple breakfast meal is okay. I kinda found their sausages a bit too oily to my liking, I like their benedict a bit more."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My bestie and I recently vacationed in Vancouver and found Jam on Yelp. When we arrived, we were surprised by how small it was inside and the length of the line, but do not be swayed! Totally worth it! We opted to sit at the bar and had a great conversation with our server who gave us some great suggestions on the menu. We both had a normal egg and bacon breakfast but at the server's suggestion we ordered one of the Cinnamon Cream Cheese pancakes to share. I honestly have to say that it was one of the best things we ate on our trip. So much so that we came back the next day for breakfast! The Cranberry Sourdough bread is also worth a try! Great spot for breakfast, we didn't try lunch but the menu sounded just as promising."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Perhaps the best eggs Benedict I have ever had, out of 100+ benedicts in over 15 countries. Truly a delight. The vegetarian Benedict was absolutely scrumptious. Worth a trip to Vancouver just for the dish. 5 stars."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Only reason 4 stars was the wait...but once you're seated and get your food, you understand why. Best breakfast or brunch in town. Shout out to our servers. Great Job!!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food was exceptionally delicious. I had the eggs Benny with fried chicken, friends had the pancakes and French toast and hubby had the Reuben with fries. So good! My only complaint is the service was questionable. I know there is a line out the door, but we waited for thirty minutes, give us at least tone to enjoy our meal! We were rushed the whole time from the get go. That was unpleasant. Other than that, excellent food! Would definitely come back!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"10 stars. This place is perfect. The food is high quality, creative and perfectly prepared. The drinks are amazing and there is a coffee bar. The service could not have been better either. Everyone was so friendly and competent. This is my new favorite breakfast place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,If the lineups weren't 1 hour long I would go more often. The chicken and waffles are crunchy and delicious. The Caesar was nice and spicy! All they need to do is expand and they will get 5stars from me
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Holy sh*t I got up at 7am to beat the rush, it was like 28 days later just a small rag tag group of survivors out for pre-brunch breakfast like old people and farmers eat. I got some kind of luscious dinosaur sized bowl of biscuits and gravy and potatoes I don't even know. It was like $12 and I haven't eaten again - and this was last month. Make sure to spoil the ending for the people in the line outside (Bruce Willis is a ghost MFs)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely positively the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. I consider myself to be a breakfast guru and hate lines but the 1.5 hour wait was 1000%  worth it. The service, the food, and the atmosphere were all A++. YAY for Jam Cafe!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,After 3 days of snowboarding at Whistler my wife and I stay one night in Vancouver where in the next morning we randomly found this restaurant on Yelp because it was nearby. We walked in and were immediately seated. I had The Gravy Coupe which is a big biscuit topped with southern fried chicken breast and two sunny side eggs all in a pool of delicious gravy. My wife had the Brioche French Toast which was a mountain of French Toast that I was surprised my lady  finished in one sitting. We later learned that this was such a popular place that people are usually lined up outside and down the street waiting for seating. So we were lucky!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"After waiting in line for 1 hour 15 minutes, I can now say I have tried Jam Cafe. Was I happy with the experience? I would say the wait was not that bad, since I was with a friend that I enjoyed just catching up in this breezy Friday morning. The service was awesome. Decor was cozy. And the food? Hmm to me it tastes like what a hipster Denny's would serve. I had the biscuits with eggs and chorizo. Nothing was memorable. Portion was huge like the other reviews mentioned but I had no desire to bring back what was left. In fact I had to ask the waitor to take away my plate because I could not look at the food any more. There are breakfast places with much shorter line up that give me better experience than this. So I am not coming back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"In Vancouver 3 days ate here all three days.  Best breakfast in a long time.  Expect to wait in line, but more than worth it.  Really great place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"There is always a line up. Why I ask myself. Well now that I have waited in the line and have had a chance to have brunch here, I know why. The line moves pretty quickly if you don't have more than 4 people in your group. It looks like there is only 2 tables that can accommodate 6 people. It was raining pretty hard outside and we didn't have an umbrella. The hostess came by and asked if we needed an umbrella. Very nice of her. We were seated approximately after waiting 30 minutes. Once we were seated the server came by right away and took our drink order. It is always a fine line between asking if you are ready to order or to give people time to figure out what to eat. The server checked on us as I wasn't ready yet. I appreciate that she didn't rush me to order but also checked back soon after so that I wasn't waiting too long either. It was difficult for me to choose my brunch item as everything sounded so good. I finally chose the chicken french toast, it was so good. The chicken was crispy but not dried out and the French toast was cooked perfectly. Will be back and worth the line up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This restaurant was on a couple of recommendation lists for Vancouver, and I think it's a solid breakfast place.  The service was attentive and super friendly.  The food was good; the portions are huge so I would recommend either getting some of the half portion options or getting sides in lieu of a full plate."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My husband and I visited Jam Cafe twice while on vacation to Vancouver. It did not disappoint. We went shortly after opening time on a weekday and were seated right away at the bar. FYI-it's pretty crowded inside if that bothers you. The food was amazing. I ordered the red velvet pancakes the first time. So good, but such a hug portion that I couldn't finish them. The second time I ordered the biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns. Usually biscuits can be dry and tasteless but these tasted like pure homemade goodness and the sausage gravy was delicious-give me more though!!  Servers and hostess were super sweet and friendly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I could tell this was a popular place because we showed up 15 minutes before it opened and still didn't get a table. After a 30 minute wait we got in and were treated like royalty. The menu is diverse and there are so many great options. I decided to try something that I usually wouldn't...for me that was a bad decision as I didn't care for the food that I ordered. I, in no way, blame the restaurant. I took a shot, and missed! I'm sure it was exactly as it should be. The waiter asked me if I wanted to box up my leftovers and I respectfully declined. Soon after the manager approached me and asked if I wanted to get something else instead and I told him that wasn't necessary and that it was me, not the kitchen. To my amazement they comped the meal. I did not expect that to happen! So I say kudos to Jam on Beatty for being so understanding and really looking for the customers best interest. I paid the server the for the meal in tip and will definitely come back and order something that I know I will enjoy more. This is how a business should be run. Thank you!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Not group friendly, have to wait even more than 30 mins outside on a Monday 10:30am morning. Though group of 2 did not need to wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Long lines. Friendly staff. Solid portions. Tasty food. Decent price. Dragon girl and i waited a solid 30 mins for a table whilst in the rain. Happily, one of the staff was kind enough to bring out waffle slices and maple butter for people to try and snack on while waiting. Once inside our orders were taken promptly. I got the gravy coop and dragon girl got the large charlie bowl. Holy moley the charlie bowl is huuuuuge. That was easily 2-3 meals worth of food in a monster bowl. The fried chicken for my dish was good but the plate could have used some more gravy as my 2nd biscuit was left without any. The charlie bowl also could have used a bit more moisture. When i reheated the leftovers i added some water and it made a huge difference. My freshly squeezes oj tasted a bit like a mix betwern freshly squeezed and tropicana, not sure if they maybe mix the two a bit... still good though. Definitely get there before 1030 if you dont want to wait more than 30 mins."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Get here early.  Fantastic breakfast!  Excellent service!  This place is meticulously clean and it is reflected in the quality of the experience!  Go for anything with a biscuit.  The Charlie is indeed huge! The little Charlie is plenty!  I loved this place and I'll definitely be back!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Brunch was okay , I just don't think it's worth the 45-1hr wait! I don't think that the food and or restaurant is spectacular ."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Probably the best thing that's ever happened to Vancouver for breakfast and brunch. 

Line ups are abit long but generally if there's a long line up its gonna be good ;) It was no longer than a 10 min wait during the week.   (Weekend is probably a different story).  But I'll tell you, it's worth the wait.

Service was amazing, got greeted right away and our server had a genuine smile on her face and made good conversation with me and my sister.   Food came really fast (for how busy it is in there).  Generally in busy places like that, when it's fast, the food is usually half-ass quality.  But at Jam this is not the case.    I ordered the Blackstone Eggs Benny with avocado added to it and the bacon is something else.  I don't know what they put in it (tasted like bourbon and maple) but I'm ordering a pile it on the side next time.  Eggs were cooked to perfection and the portions were big.  The food far exceeded my expectations.   Was very reasonably priced as well.  

Great place, highly recommend.   Will definitely be coming back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fried chicken Benny's! Winner Winner Chicken.....Brunch. The wait is worth it!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I keep going back for more.  I once even waited 2 hours to get into this spot.  
Their menu is versatile and so far everything I have tried is delicious - but my favorite is their eggs benny.  
This is a wonderful brunch spot if you are looking for delicious comfort food, big portions and don't mind waiting in line for a little while."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I don't get the hype... everything was okay and service was great but not worth the line-up out front. There are more notable options nearby in the city. This is worth stopping in at one, but I won't be back. The portion sizes are very generous however."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I went here twice out of three days i had in Vancouver. Pretty much everything I tasted at this place was bordering 5 stars. We did have to wait almost an hour but that's pretty expected considering it was Saturday around 11. 

My favorite - Fried chicken on biscuits with all the other good stuff

Also Great - Green eggs and ham. The pesto and spinach on eggs was excellent, and the biscuits were delicious as always.

I had a few bites of my Mom's banana walnut pancakes and they were also incredible. I'd say this is a must visit while in Vancouver."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"It was pouring rain outside but we heard Jam was a must so we stayed. So grateful we did. Even the hostess was incredible, offering encouragement to not desert the line, hand out umbrellas and walk up and down the line informing the line about wait times. Inside was so adorable and smelled amazing. We had a party of four and we all ordered breakfast and the boys after tasting it, put in a lunch order too to go. Our server was upbeat and friendly. She chatted with us a bit after to give us ""must do"" in Victoria. Just a wonderful experience and I would highly suggest going. Arrive hunger (maybe bring a small snack pack haha for the line). The food is soooooo good. Big portions, beautiful presentation and delicious."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Good sign when there was a line up on a Tuesday morning. Foods are in big portion, so go there hungry. My favourite is their jam, very tasty. Service is good as well. Highly recommended."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great place with great food and great service... will definitely recommend! Very convenient to come early morning when they open at 8am. Only few seats were taken when we came at 8:10, but after 15 minutes, the place filled up already and few people are waiting outside for the seat to be available. Definitely worth the drive and wait if you needed to wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,It was nice. I had heard about this place for a while. I look forward to going back and trying it again for a more in depth review. Definitely deserves a second chance.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Super food and portions plus fabulous service. You can mix and match a lot of the food which I love to do. Having one pancake for dessert is always a must. Usually long lines, but wait is worth it and many times only a 15-20min wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Definitely worth the rating people have been giving it... But come hungry or skip a meal the night before. The pictures are legit, the staff is great. The green hot sauce needs to go on everything. I didn't get the red velvet pancake but I so wanted a bit of it from the stranger next to me.  They really need to make a sampler plate with one of those on it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Let's start out by saying Great Food but looong wait. Thanksgiving Monday 11:40am started to line-up. We were made to line-up outside (I stress you have to physically line up, no wait list) By 12:15pm we were getting antsy as last order is 2pm and we're not even half way yet. Luckily waitress came out and offered waffles and to let us know it'll probably be another 1/2 hour wait. OK we got seated close to 1pm. Of course we already knew what to order. Food came quickly as all delicious. Finished lunch at 1:30pm hoping we can give our seats to those poor folks outside. So it was 1.5 hours lining up for 1/2 hour enjoyment. Is it worth it? I honestly don't think I will do this again anytime soon but I have the memory to take with me always sigh :("
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We all enjoyed our visit here in Vancouver. We couldn't decide what to order. Everything looked delicious. Two of us went with one of the many versions of Benedicts they offer, I had the pigs in a blanket (sausage dipped in pancake patter like corn dogs) and someone else chose the red velvet pancakes! We also had mimosas and bloody Mary's!  Plan on waiting outside for about 30-45 minutes though. But we all agreed it was worth it!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food is so good! Great that I can get take out and not have to wait in line. We first tried it in Victoria and loved the food and am happy to see they are in Vancouver. Hope they expend as the line up never seem to cease.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I came here with my brother while he was in town visiting. I thought because it was a weekday that there wouldn't be a line, but there was. The wait was only about 5 mins, so not too bad. I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend. But the wait was worth it. I had the veggie eggs benedict and I can't remember what my brother had, but we both loved our dishes."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Overrated for sure, but perhaps I just got the wrong thing for myself. I didn't like the potatoes dish AT ALL - so heavy and carby with not much taste. Long wait as well, haven't gone back since my first visit and I don't think I will anytime soon."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great Brunch Experience. One of my favorites in Vancouver.
There is a line to wait in, but if you don't mind the wait the experience is worth it.
Quick service, Great Food, and Nice Staff."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We were a group of 6 and waited about 1.5 hours on a Saturday morning. The booth table was great and we felt like we had plenty of room for 6 adults + 1 baby. 

2 of us got the Veggie Bowl (like the Charlie Bowl). I think it's most redeeming quality is the size - I must have eaten 1/3 of it and brought the rest home. We both agreed it was a heavy dish, lots of potato and biscuit (which was very good) and could have done with more veggies. Probably would not get again. 

Others had the French toast with caramelized apples (very sweet but delicious), the macaroni skillet (Ritz crumble was great), green eggs and ham (good but not exceptional), and classic eggs Benny (pretty good). 

Overall, it didn't quite meet my expectations based on previous reviews, but perhaps I should have chosen something that was less potato focused. Would return to try a chicken and waffle dish, pancakes, or the French toast. Wait was longer than we expected but we were a large group. 

Note for parents: no high chairs, though they do have booster seats for older children. My 10 month old sat beside me in the booth no problem, but something to note."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Took a girl's trip to Vancouver last October and was given the recommendation to visit this spot for brunch. The line was out the door, given the small space, but it was so worth the wait! Thinking about the food at this moment is making me drool.. and the drink selection is a plus! Would highly recommend this place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"A long lineup on a freezing cold day for a holiday brunch. But the servers actually brought out waffle samples; a nice surprise! A bit crowded but cute, cozy, and warm inside. Service was amazing and the bennies and waffles were excellent. We ordered two different fruit toppings for the waffles just to try them, but wouldn't do that again because both were too sweet to eat much though otherwise tasty. Coffee was OK - better than at the average restaurant. If not for the lineup, I would go there again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I dare anyone to give this place less than 5 stars. This is hands down the best breakfast joint I have ever eaten at. I had the Huevos Rancheros which did not disappoint. Great flavor especially with a sprinkling of their house made jalapeño sauce. No matter what you do GET THE BACON. ALL OF IT. Great mimosas. The Bloody Mary looked like perfection. Wish I lived here so I could come back.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Just as good as they say. Worth the 20 min wait. Food and drinks were incredible. Am definitely coming back here.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The chicken waffles were very Rosemary forward but still good. We had the ""little Charlie"" which by not means was little. It was a huge bowl of mostly potatoes and biscuit and didn't have much flavour to it. Even though it was highly recommended by the hostess and she even mentioned it as fan favourite. Then there was the black stone Benny not much to be said by that either. The place looks really cool very rustic Canadian feel to it. Staff was friendly."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Love the brunch menu here! Huge line ups on weekends so go prepared to wait. Service is quick and very friendly.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Contrary to what a lot of people seem to think on here, for anybody with slightly discerning tastes, this place is not worth the wait and lineups. There are much better breakfast and brunch options in Vancouver with little or no wait. That said the food is not bad, just nothing to line up for. It's not special. Just fine. Don't buy into the hype."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Perfect Fried chicken breast benefit with perfect poached egg  + caramelize banana & strawberry Waffle board  my goodness taste of heaven
Jam Cafe on Beatty,This place is sooooo good!!! Want breakfast in Vancouver?!?! Come here! They also play really good music!! I recommend getting the egg Benedict with fried chicken. It's nice inside and the staff is nice and helpful. There's a bit of a wait but it's because it's good
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fell in love with this place in Victoria and am so thrilled they are in Vancouver now. Great brunch spot
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food is NOT worth the wait.  We waited for an hour in the rain and ordered their famous bowls.  Even the little bowl was humongous and the biscuit, hash browns, cheese and gravy mixed into a bowl of just mushy gooy paste that you have no idea what you are eating.  If you are going to try it, I would recommend to stay away from the bowls.  No one in my party finished their bowls and no one wanted to pack home the left over."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My family and I were visiting our friends to the North. Staying in Vancouver, we knew we had to do brunch. We had been told several times that brunch in Vancouver was a thing. A big thing. This place had great reviews and was near our hotel, so we trekked over one morrning and tried it out. There was a long line, and it took a while to be seated, but it was worth it. This place did not disappoint. The drinks were good, the food was great, and the service was wonderful. I had high expectations and this place met them, for sure. The place isn't that big, which is why there is a long wait. But it's a cute spot with fun dishes. Definitely a must go-to place for brunch in a city where brunch is the most important meal of the day."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here for breakfast with my boyfriend on a Sunday mornin as we live down the stairs. I saw this place ""in the making""  and was wondering what took so long to open! Now we know and it was worth the wait! We waited in line for about 20 min but that was OK. We loved the decor of this newly renovated space and the vibe was great. The handmade furniture and funky design made the interior welcoming. The food was outstanding! I had the half size veggie bowl (thanks to the server for being honest about sizes) and my boyfriend had the heurvos ranchos -  both meals were delicious and generously portioned. I had to take half of mine home but my boyfriend finished his. Will definitely be back to try out other yummy items! So great to have another delicious place nearby :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food was wonderful however the manner in which the customers are treated: as trough fed cattle was awful. I won't be back for this reason. Very embarrassing to bring and out of town friend here. An unfortunate coincidence was that the neighboring table was a Chinese super elite ultra rich teenager taking cigarette breaks and spiting food everywhere. Gross haha!!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Ok, we heard about this place from a waiter at a local bar.  Best breakfast we enjoyed all week while in Vancouver.  Its true what they say about getting here early.  We got here at 7:30am on a Saturday morning and were the 2nd ones in line.  at 7:40 there was a line about 50 people deep.  For those that waited , I'd imagine the 2nd wave would be in within 40-50 minutes. Get a coffee, and get here early, relax and enjoy!  They welcome you nicely and the staff is all friendly and knows the menu well.  I believe the manager or owner was even jumping in the mix and helping with orders and expediting service to everyone.   The place fills up immediately, but isn't loud or crowded.  The interior is fun quirky, hip, yet reminiscent of a traditional farm to table breakfast that you'd expect.  We ordered the breakfast skillet and Huevos Rancheros.  Both were amazing with coffee and fresh squeezed OJ.   They were served with Multi grain toast and killer raspberry jam.   The portions were enormous, hot and tasted delicious.  This place is a hidden Gem on Beatty St. and is most worthy of a visit when you're in Vancouver.  We just hopped in a cab and were there in a few minutes from Yaletown. i couldn't stop ogling everyone's dishes because I wanted to try everything on their extensive menu. We will be back the next time in Vancouver.  This place is excellent!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We went last Saturday morning and must have waited for about 1h20, but it was worth it! I got the Gravy's Coop with mushroom gravy and fried pork belly... I'll still raving about how yummy it is to anyone who'd listen! Can't wait to go back again, but at 8 AM to skip the line."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Prices are fair, portions are godzilla, food is top notch; seems like everybody's dream restaurant which is why there's always a line even at 9 am

Good food presentation isn't often present with cheaper end restaurants but Jam Cafe has stellar presentation

Now with the relatively cheap food prices they offset that with their drinks, portion isn't as generous and prices is on the higher side; you can expect about $20 or so per person here

Service here is at the pinnacle of perfection if you get seated at the bar, the barista there is awesome

Pros:
+ Food
+ Portion
+ Presentation

Cons:
- Wait times
- Limited seating
- Larger groups can expect to wait longer"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So worth the wait! The service and food are great. Pro tip- you can order the pancakes individually which is worth it because they are huge! I ordered two (instead of the default three) and could only finish one delicious, monstrous pancake. The skillet is awesome too. If you can go on a weekday morning you can avoid the crazy lineups."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Service is off, and wait is very long. Would be okay if they set the right expectations. 35 minutes turned into 1 hour 5 minutes, plus 30 min to get food. That's before you actually start to eat. Major expectation setting fail. Great if 2 - 2:30 hours for breakfast is what you expected, but if you had other things in mind you may end up having to cancel those plans."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Last time I came I didn't bring my passport so I couldn't try the Jam Royals which I really want to try. So I just tried the meal it tasted good. Today I have been waiting on line for an hour and asked a lady Can I just get a coffee she said yes! After I got a sit and finally got my special coffee (Jam Royals- tastes really good) there is an lady who is wearing glasses keep coming and asked me order food. I said I'm ok. She came again I said I'm full. She said normally people come not just a coffee. I said but I'm full. And I saw another service asked her would you want me to change my sit to the bar so people can come to sit. She said you're alright don't worry very nice lady. Then the girl who is wearing glasses came to ask again are you ok? Do you want some food? ... I feel so sad, I can't just get a coffee today? She keep asking me order food more than five times I feel so bad...... feels like I'm a bad person......"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Huge portions, excellent coffee, not the typical breakfast fare. I highly recommend splitting up breakfast unless you are a super eater. We tried the pesto eggs with biscuits. Be prepared for a strange color of scrambled eggs. I think they did a good job but I am not a fan of pesto with eggs. The biscuit was huge and one half was plenty for one person. I can imagine their pancakes are amazing."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Loved the food and service! So many fried chicken options I felt like I was in heaven. Only downside is the long wait. My advice.. find a friend who is willing to wait in line for you.. then show up when it's time to chow down!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm and lined up and waited for about 40 mins wait. Menu is very extensive and I ended up with the Little Charlie. It was the small one but the portion is huge. Good value for $12.00. However, there was not much ham and cheese, just lots of potatoes. It was hard to eat out of a bowl without breaking the eggs or eating the eggs first. Service was great and came around checking to make sure water was filled up and everything was good. The caesar was really good compare to other places."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We are considering moving to Canada so that we can eat here more often.

There was the expected wait in line for a table, but the food was exceptional. The gravy coop was great on every respect. My wife's cinnamon bun pancakes tasted like Cinnabon in the best way. Also noted that an order of pancakes here could feed three hungry people.

Service was also great, our server was very nice.

Overall one of the best brunch places we've ever found."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"OMG this place is so delicious!  2 things: I don't usually visit a restaurant twice in an unfamiliar area and I don't order biscuits and gravy out.  I ordered the Gravy Couple just based on popularity and it was amazing.  I'm very skeptical of eating biscuits outside of the South and getting gravy out is even rarer for me. I was amazed by both! Who knew Vancouver could make delicious biscuits?  (For the record,  I don't eat any biscuits in SoCal). And the chicken along with the gravy made this an amazing dish.  I loved the dish so much that I came back two days later to order the Green Eggs and Ham.  Also,  was not disappointed.  Next time I'm in Vancouver,  I'll be sure hit this place up."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Probably the best brunch I've ever had.  Super cute atmosphere too.  Ordered the jammer mimosa and the bourbonator caesar.  Both were excellent!  The old town breakfast was super simple and SO delicious.  Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I'm glad Jam has opened a spot in Vancouver. I loved my visit to Victoria. It is busy though, and i think they will stay that way for a very long time. We went at 11am on a Thursday and still had a 20-30 minute wait (the weekends must be insane) The food is great, big portions and delicious. The pancakes are huge! My friend ordered one for the side and it was massive. My only gripe is the hostess at the front is very unorganized. Do we just wait in line, do we need to put our names down?? I got asked at least three times what the procedure was and I also had no idea. Some communication with your waiting guests would be appreciated."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Wow! This place was totally worth the wait. My husband and I arrived around 9:00 and had to wait 20-25 minutes. Inside was very cozy and we both had Irish coffees to warm us up. My husband loved his chicken and waffles! I ordered the gravy coops with fried chicken. We barely finished our food because the portions were big and the food is very rich but we couldn't stop eating! So so so delicious.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely made our trip to Vancouver! We received a recommendation (more like demand) that we go to the jam cafe for breakfast by a wonderful bartender/cocktail artist at the Pourhouse in Gastown. We arrived later in the morning and a nice line had already formed. We waited for about an hour, but when we finally got seated it was certainly worth it. The French toast with bananas and strawberries was amazing, and my husband overestimated his stomach and went for the Charlie bowl. Neither of us could get through half of our plates! The service was very fast and lovely. Amazing food at good prices. I learned there is also an original location in downtown Victoria where we are headed next, so we will have to get another visit in!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"If you don't have to wait too long, this is a great breakfast spot.  Service was fast and friendly, decor is hipster country cool, and the food, most importantly, was fresh and flavourful.  I wouldn't line up for an hour, but is a definite recommend."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Super delicious chicken and waffles. Waffles a little soft for my liking...I like a little more crunch on the outside but solid solid dish. Great fried chicken, and gravy. Larger portions here then I've seen at most places in Vancouver. Hearty food all around. It'll all stick to your ribs. Except maybe the yogurt...they've got something for everyone. :)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My family of five went several times on a recent trip. Very creative menu, large portions, super friendly staff and the kitchen was happy to make adjustments to accommodate our desires. As lovely as Vancouver is, there are not many great breakfast spots, especially near the Chinatown Skytrain stop. This would be popular is any city. Yes, we waited 30 minutes every time, but at least we knew exactly what we were getting into. It's just a line and you stay in it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had the little Charlie bowl, and now I have trust issues because it was not little at all lol it was delicious ! The line was long but I found it moved quite quickly and best of all service was great !"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"3 stars as this eatery is ok.  The hour or so wait in the cold and rain is definitely not worth what you get. Breakfast tastes like Thanksgiving, and the prices are somewhat inflated. Nice location, and cozy ambiance, with friendly service."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Stop looking for another brunch spot (other than cafe medina) this place is absolutely delicious. It's mostly heavier, comfort food like breakfast foods but so so delicious! Be prepared to wait in line for a bit, this place is busy."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We'd go there again. The bowls are huge and filled with mostly hash browns and biscuits, which are tasty but very filling. I think when we go there again I want to try the pancakes! Worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Line out the door at 9:30 on a weekday morning.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing. We all ordered different items and enjoyed them all. HUGE portions!!!  Easily can share any dish.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We waited for this one, but wouldn't choose to do so again.  Least we should expect from a heavy breakfast is some flavour! So many better brunch options in the city!  Food and service wise."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Best breakfast place in Vancouver. Simply amazing. Great food and generous portion sizes. It can be a long wait (the first time I went was on a wednesday at 10am and I waited an hour) but it is worth it. The service is great and prompt. When waiting outside, the server was gracious enough to bring me and my wife some coffee. I've had Fried Chicken and Waffles on the first visit and the Eggs Benedict with Fried Chicken on the second. Both were amazing. Will definitely come back again."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely delicious, thoughtfully prepared food, I'm particular about how my poached eggs are done and they made them perfect! Biscuits were excellent and the baked oatmeal dish was something special. Looking at the foods coming out of the kitchen all looked equally well prepared all customers looked happy. Wish I had more time to spend in Vancouver so I could stop in again. They make a wonderful London fog. Clean, beautifully decorated breakfast/lunch place don't miss it."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Cozy place with tasty food. Chicken-n-waffles is just what I had in mind for a breakfast.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Expect no less than an hour wait for weekend brunches (before 2pm), but once you're inside you'll know it's worth it. Love their bennies and pancakes! Not a big fan of their charley bowl, but it's definitely unique. Service is great as well"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I cannot even begin to describe how good this place is.  I first discovered Jam Cafe when I was a tour guide in Victoria.  Now, not only is the service and the food exceptional, but I don't wait in lines, and just recently i waited 90 mins!  They sit guests till three, so if you arrive at 245pm, you may just slip right in for last call.  Now their menu, what's the big deal?  They take traditional breakfast items and make it a billion times better.  Farmers Skillet is outstanding!  Don't even get me started on their bowl.  The Little Charlie bowl is large enough.  I will be back.  I will wait in line.  I love to show off this little gem to out of town visitors."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great service and environment. We got the Charlie Bowl and the Gravy Coop which came in huge portions! Food was amazing and will definitely come back to try other dishes!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"The food and service were phenomenal. My boyfriend and I got there around 9:20 on a Thursday. We waited a few minutes and got a seat at the bar. Kicking myself because I didn't catch her name, but the bartender was awesome. Had an enjoyable conversation with her and fellow diners did most of our meal. Both her and the hostess were incredibly helpful in suggesting places to do- they wrote down brewery names and gave us a program for the film festival to look through. We were beyond grateful and so impressed with the service. 
People aside, the food was incredible. Reasonably priced and huge portions. I got the brioche French toast and my boyfriend got the skillet. Both delicious. The jalapeño hot sauce is house made and so so delicious. 
The Vancouver brunch scene has been ruined for me, as I don't think I'll be going anywhere else."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Wow!!! Huge portion sizes with great quality. Definitely a brunch I would recommend despite the long wait time (1h or more). Great service. Try the Charly bowl and red velvet pancakes.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"good food, gets busy so be prepaired to wait in line . but well worth the wait, very hipsters decor and the servers are on point.. will be back for sure!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Incredibly delicious! I love going for brunch and despite the 20 min wait, I was happy and I hate waiting in a queue for anything!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Got here 8am & was told 25 minute wait. At 8:55am we left with 4 people still in front of us. Really wish the hostess had not made us wait that long...... so one star for Jam since we never ate their food!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"What can I say that probably hasn't already been said, this place is AMAZING! I was visiting Vancouver from Syracuse, NY and staying at the Hilton property close by with two friends from St. Louis and Las Vegas. I went for a run my first morning there and when I ran by at 8:30am on a Thursday with a line out the door I knew it must be something special and I was NOT disappointed. My friends and I got up early the next morning to get their right after 8:00am and we got right in which I would recommend. Our server was delightful, a sweet Irish guy who handled our rowdy selves quite well (we've all traveled extensively for work so we are a handful but a fun handful and he was great!). The. Food. Was. Amazing. Seriously, we all had FOMO watching all the different plates being delivered around us that we hadn't ordered. Prices were reasonable, atmosphere was amazing, food was to die for, staff was friendly, hands down one of the best places I have ever eaten. We loved it so much we went back the next morning, DEFINITELY check this place out if you have the chance!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Well worth the wait in line! I don't think there is one thing on the menu I wouldn't get. Mouth watering dishes. The cinnamon swirl pancake was AMAZING! Literally a gooey cinnamon bun in pancake form. The skillets were also very tasty. Lovely staff.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I followed Yelp's tips and was able to skip the long line by going solo. The service was fantastic, I had the chicken eggs Benedict but wanted the biscuit instead of muffins. They accommodated to my request without any extra charges! I must say though that the food, though really good, was not as extraordinary as I had expected from all the raves on Yelp."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!! Went to Jam over the summer and I'm still thinking about the food. Friendly atmosphere and awesome breakfast. I tried one of the eggs benny with bacon, avo and tomato and only got the half order, which I really regretted. If you're in the area, or not, eat here!!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We here visiting From Seattle and we were in search of the perfect breakfast spot!  We found it here!  Well worth the wait!  Everything we ordered was divine. My husband had traditional eggs Benedict, my son the French toast, my daughter had the eggs Benedict with the sugar cured bacon and I had the huevos rancheros. We were all happy campers!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,First time for my wife and I at Jam. Great atmosphere and service. Both of our egg dishes were a little over cooked and the hash brown potatoes were pretty generic. The presentation and garnishes were right on.  Some home fries or cheese grits would  have made a perfect breakfast for us. Still a solid 4 stars.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This is the one place I don't mind waiting an hour, I love that it is pretty organized for such a long line up. It is a perfect cheat meal! I ordered the pork belly benny and my partner had the Charlie Bowl, and it was so much food we had enough for dinner."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,I went there at 8 sharp and there was already a number of people lining up. Lukily we got the last table when the store opened. We ordered the charlie bowl and the smoked salmon egg sandwich with avocado salad. I think I expected too much for the charlie bowl. It was okay for me. So much amount of food though.. I like the salmon sandwich better! Servers were all nice too. I wouldn't wait in line more than 30 mins though..
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fantastic. From start to finish. I had the chorizo benny. Mmmm. My friend had the veggie benny. She finished that faster than you could blink. Definitely will be back to try more items on that menu
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Absolutely amazing! Great atmosphere, quick service, and the best food! Overall, awesome experience and don't miss you!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Line is extremely long (over 1.5 hour wait), and it sucks that you have to stay in line to wait for a table. Other than that, food is great, and the portions are large. Great breakfast/brunch spot to check out as long as you're ready for long wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Fantastic breakfast in a great easy to get to location.  I had Huevos Rancheros and a regular drip coffee.  The place is quaint and inviting.  The staff was polite and engaging.  My waitress was super nice and gave me some great tips on what to see while in Vancouver.  She was from the same place in Victoria and they were known for breakfast there as well.  Would highly recommend.  Great music while having an enjoyable menu.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I went with a group and was able to taste a few things. It was all delicious. Well worth the wait and you can expect a line. Go early. The red velvet pancakes were intense, basically cake batter, so less of a pancake texture and more actual cake, so keep that in mind. Was worth tasting, but couldn't even get through half of it. Portions are large. Savoury dishes were divine."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,The food was good. The line was long on a Sunday morning which is expected. I ordered the heuvos rancheros which was good but my mind wasn't blown.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I had the Oldtimer breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast). The bacon is sugar cured and although I have no idea what that means I can say it is pure food nirvana. My eggs were cooked perfectly (over medium) and the cranberry sourdough toast was good. The hashbrowns were spatula sized double flip browned on one side so the perfect balance of crispy and soft. Their hot sauce is not too hot and suits breakfast perfectly. The Server was so nice and professional. Decor is pure Canadiana if not a little touristy for my taste. The table of elements on the wall is pretty awesome. We were just a party of two and the wait was 5 mins (we arrived at 9am)."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"So my wife & I have walked by here a few times recently. Always about 20 people waiting outside. Last Saturday at noon we decided to line up, 4 of us. Waited about 45 minutes. Ended up at the L shaped corner of the bar, which was great for conversation. 2 on each side. The bartender server was friendly, fun & engaging. All four of us each ordered something different. All helpings were very generous. Everything was delicious. I unfortunately ordered a basic breakfast, ham, eggs, toast etc. It was all great... But it seems you should be adventurous here. Hip, welcoming atmosphere & friendly staff all around. My coffee was great too! Will return again!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Waffles for people waiting in line was a nice touch!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"2 of us had the little Charlie and Fried chicken with French toast. The Little Charlie bowl was delicious with yummy biscuits, gravy, cheese, hash brown, ham and eggs, but it was all pretty heavy, so I couldn't get through half the bowl on my own. It's good to share this dish with someone. The fried chicken and French toast looked huge when it arrived, stacked with 4 thick pieces of French toast, but we polished it off. The sauce that came with the dish was sweet and tart and gave balance to the dish."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Love the food! Went there twice and both time was over an hour wait. Once you're inside, then it's heaven! I tried the skillet and the green eggs and ham, and it was not a disappointment. I am still considering to go back and try their famous Charlie bowl. Hopefully next time it won't be such a long wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Fantastic place.  There was a line outside, but the wait was brief.  Once inside, we were treated warmly and our server was very attentive.  We had the Caesar, Pulled-Pork Pancakes, Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and Banana Walnut Pancakes.  All of it was fantastic!  100% recommended!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Jam was our favorite breakfast spot on our trip to Vancouver. My husband ordered the chicken and French toast and hasn't stopped talking about it. We waited in line for 45 minutes on a weekday, but it was worth it. I recommend getting there early."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Great brunch!!! Portions are very generous, so if you're not that hungry, consider taking the 'half' size."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Crazy wait. Standing outside with cranky hungry kids. Silly. Not worth it. Unless you have nothing better to do on a bright Saturday morning. Go running. Not sure what you'd do if it is raining. There isn't shelter in front of the cafe.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"We both had the huevos rancheros which was quite good.  A bit more bean flavor than I'm used to, however it was delicious.  A nice touch is that the beans in the huevos are vegan, so available to a wider audience.  They also had some interesting breakfast ""cocktails"" -- I had an espresso/coffee/bailey's drink with orange sugar on the rim which was good.  We sat at the bar so could ask questions about the food, and the barista told us they had been open only two weeks.  Our neighbor at the bar had the chicken waffles which he said he really liked.
P.S. We came to the address looking for Medina for their waffles, however Medina has moved."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My fiancé and I were really excited to try Jam. We live near by and always notice the line up so we finally gave it a go, only to be disappointed with not only the food but the service too. I ordered the B.E.L.T.C.H. Sandwich with their chorizo soup and my fiancé ordered the Charlie bowl. The sandwich which I added avocado to was bland and dry. The avocado was completely hard and was no wear near being ripe. Before I asked for the avocado to be replaced with a ripe one, I had cut the sandwich in half and had a bite. It came back with a new bun on top so it appeared to be uncut and a whole new sandwich (not that I expected that), so I went ahead and cut it in half only to realize that now I destroyed the sandwich... It was falling apart since now it's been cut twice and not properly :(. The soup was okay. My fiances Charlie bowl consisted of bland and soggy hash brown with overly dry biscuit biscuit through out the ham and what ever else there was in there. The egg part was fine besides the shells we found in them. But the dish it's self was just a overly large portion of disappointment. I actually saw the waitress look at us and notice we didn't look too thrilled when we were looking at the sandwich and everything else, she walked away and when she brought the bill she didn't ask how everything was. She didn't ask in general actually. She wasn't terrible, just a little passive and ignorant. I was excited to have a cute brunch spot close by but unfortunately I wouldn't go back."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"My first ever brunch in Vancouver and finally get to visit this place! The queue in the rain was so worth it. The service is really good, they're really friendly! The food didn't take that long to be served (remembering that they're really popular and therefore crowded). I ordered Little Charlie. This menu is basically for hash brown lover because there are loads of them (there are some pork inside as well but not as much as the potato!) And even though it's ""little"", I couldn't finish it. Their chicken and waffle is OK I guess, the gravy is good, the pulled pork pancake is too sweet for me and I'm grateful it's not my responsibility to finish them ha! Their jalapeno sauce is so so good. I really LOVE them. For you who likes spicy food. The sauce was giving the food kind of a Mexicany taste to it, but it was really good you should give them a try. The B.E.L.T.C.H is really filling and there are loads of fries if you order them with fries. And I mean a lot of them. Doubt you will be able to finish it. Or if you do, you won't be needing to eat for the rest of the day. I think the little charlie was really worth it, with a price around $12, if you want to share go for the Charlie Bowl (it's massive I tell you). But overall I think these place worth the hype that has been going on. Keep up the good job! Definitely will come back again for brunch here"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I have a very soft spot for Jam Cafe. Lined up for 1.30 hours in the rain last time I visited and it was well worth it. Huge portion sizes. My most current favourite is the The Little Veggie. Eggs, creamy gravy, veggies sitting on top a of a buttery, crumbly biscuit... It's so good. Don't let the name fool you - it may be a smaller portion than The Veggie Bowl, but I easily got 3 meals out of it. Could've made it into 4 if I wanted to. Definitely one of Vancouver's best brunch/breakfast spots."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Amazing food.... So worth the wait.  The service was spectacular!  Mike, the owner, and his team were beyond hospitable and so delightful!  Hope to see them make it down the coast in the US and in SoCAL soon!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"incredible food, it was as simple as that. the greeter who handed out waffle samples to people waiting in line and chatted with us during the insane (but worthwhile) 45 minute wait was adorable and outgoing. the blood orange mimosa and the Pimm's cup were delicious."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Yes, it's true! There are line ups depending on time, and day of the week, but completely understandable. Two words...delicious and creative (without being too out there). You'll want to try everything but of course you can't so you just have to come back multiple times. Space is tight but somehow, it feels right. Staff is enthusiastic, positive and accommodating."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I think I'm in looooove. I hate waiting in lines but i was told it was worth the wait and guess what it is! Servings are gigantic and so delicious. Delicious red velvet pancakes, delicious baked oatmeal, delicious waffles.... Just delicious. Service is also really good!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This was our last stop of our vacation to B.C. I did mass amounts of research because I wanted the best breakfast (favorite meal) in the city for a decent price. My husband ordered the Charlie Bowl which I had seen mentioned numerous times in my research and it was exactly as described, HUGE which my husband loved! He was able to eat about 1/4 of it and then snacked on it the entire way back to Oregon. I had the Brioche French Toast with carmelized apples and it was exactly what I was craving! We will definitely be going back the next time we are there!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"I've been waiting to come back to Jam Cafe since Victoria day last year and again, it did not disappoint. It took quite long to get back here because of the never ending and always present line ups. But I have gathered that between 8-9 am are the best times to go. You'll need to force yourself to wake up early on those days off just to make it here before a line up starts!

Going on to the food, the first time I had the daily special which was a lemon meringue waffle. The curd was perfectly tart and not overly sweet. The waffle itself I couldn't remember too much of.. but I would say it's not as good as the waffles from Nero's.
My partner in crime decided on the gravy coupe. It was definitely delicious, especially with their home-made jalapeño sauce. I think the only complaint he had was that there wasn't enough gravy for him to finish everything on his plate. A big portion of the biscuit was left untouched.

This time, I had the soup of the day which was chorizo corn chowder and the infamous red velvet pancake. Neither disappointed. The chowder had a more soup-y consistency than a chowder, but the flavour was there and there was TONS of chorizo. They did NOT skimp on the ingredients. Red velvet pancake was absolutely worth every calorie. I ordered just the half order (thank god!) - which is just ONE HUMONGOUS pancake covered with cream cheese icing. I'm still eating the leftovers for it whilst writing this review. The part that they did very well with this red velvet was that it actually HAD the chocolate flavour to it (unlike most places). I'm loving it even after microwaving it.
Partner this time had the salmon benny. He said he was afraid he couldn't finish the full order, but he scarfed down the entire thing within minutes. That's not to say that the portion was small, he just couldn't stop eating it! Again, paired with that jalapeño sauce, boyfriend didn't have a chance. Side note that I wanted to mention was that when ordering, they give you a choice of how well done you want your poached egg to be. That was a nice touch. 

Overall service is great. The only thing I dislike is that it's very popular and I can't bring myself to wake up at 7:30 on weekends to come here before the line starts! Still looking forward to the next thing I'll try though (and i already know what it is.. chicken and waffles.. i'm coming for you!!)"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Found this place on Yelp app. Had good reviews and we agree.  Great food and service. Be early as can have a line waiting at the door.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Was about 20min wait but totally worth it! Definitely need to stop here for a breakfast in your Vancouver trip.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"One of the best spots in town to come for brunch! Although there is usually a line-up, I find that it moves pretty quickly and the food is definitely worth the wait. I recommend the charlie bowl or the veggie bowl. Just keep in mind though, that the small bowl itself is quite large! I usually bring home leftovers. The waiters were kind and helpful, the ambiance was nice, and the food was excellent. This is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a big, delicious brunch!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"This place is amazing. Although still relatively new in town, it's quickly become one of our favourite brunch spots in the city. Favourite dishes include: Chicken French Toast, Chicken and Waffles, & Pulled Pork Pancakes. For the Caesar lovers out there, the Bourbonator with its candied bacon topping is just heaven. Lineup can be long, so get there early!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great atmosphere. The eggs Benedict dish was good. However the French toast was very chewy and soggy and topped with so much sauce that the amount of sugar in it made it impossible to eat. Also the waffle board was very disappointing because of the amount of the blueberry sauce on it. The waffles were literally completely soaked in the sauce and were very soggy. Next time I'd try all the sauces on the side. Perhaps I could leave a better review then.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Huge portions. Had little Charlie with some coffee but couldn't finish it all. Really good breakfast food. Highly recommended.
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Was so excited to find out my favourite breakfast joint in Victoria would be coming to Vancouver. I don't mess around when it comes to brunch, it's the most religious thing I do on Sundays. This place is so bomb -  everything is made from scratch. Their chicken and waffles are an instant cure for a hangover, it's practically miraculous. Friendly staff, cool decor, all around great place."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Unbelievably delicious. Humongous portions. We had the little Charlie, still huge. French toast was delicious.would totally come back. Worth the wait."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Definitely worth the wait, we got the chorizo and vegetarian bennies and both were amazing! For dessert, we got the red velvet pancakes, they were super dense so I would recommend getting the half order with 1 pancake not 3 pancakes. My only issue was that the I ordered a latte and the milk was burnt thats why it is not getting 5 stars."
Jam Cafe on Beatty,"Went here for brunch for the first time and had a wonderful experience. I was being super indecisive of what I wanted and our server, I forget his name (he had an awesome accent) helped me pick a great dish. You could tell he  enjoyed his job and helped guide me through the menu. The food came out and the portions were huge!!! We both had Benny's, I went for the classic and it did not disappoint. Amazing service (seriously our server was the best) and amazing food!!!!!!! Well done jam!"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Amazing spot. Went twice in our one week visit (so far). Staff is incredibly friendly. Food is delicious. Portions are huge!!! Worth the wait but definitely go early!
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Great great food! Be prepared to wait! Only bad thing is that while I was in line a homeless man harassed me and I felt really unsafe... I didn't know the area to be like that.
